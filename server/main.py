"""
Choose Your Mystery — FastAPI Backend
======================================
Thin server that wraps the existing Python generation/interrogation/coherence
logic and exposes it over HTTP for the Godot client.

All Claude API calls happen here. The Godot client never touches the API key.

Endpoints:
  POST /generate          — generate a new mystery from a prompt
  POST /interrogate       — ask a character a question (in-character reply)
  POST /rate              — save a viability rating for a mystery
  GET  /mysteries         — list saved mysteries
  GET  /mysteries/{slug}  — load a saved mystery by slug

Run locally:
  cd /path/to/SocialGaming
  python3 -m uvicorn server.main:app --reload --port 8000

SESSION ANNOTATION — Phase 1 complete when:
  curl -X POST localhost:8000/generate \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"prompt":"a murder on a train","opening_narration":true}'
  returns a valid mystery JSON with _provenance and _coherence fields.

SELECTED PARTS:
{parts_block}

{guidance_block}

WRITE IT BACKWARDS. This is the order the JSON below is in, and it is not cosmetic.

Decide the SOLUTION first — culprit, motive, method, and the numbered chain of reasoning that
gets a player there. Only then write the cast, and only then the clues, each one planted to serve
a step of that chain. This is how mysteries are written for novels and screen, and it matters more
here than it does on paper: you are composing left to right, so whatever you write first is what
everything after it is conditioned on. Write the solution last and you are improvising an
explanation for clues you already committed to — and when the cast does not support the chain you
need, the cheapest thing to do is invent a person who is not in it. That has happened: a generated
mystery scored a clean coherence pass while its reasoning turned on four people who appear nowhere
in its own character list.

So the rule that follows from it, and it is absolute:

  EVERY PERSON, PLACE OR OBJECT NAMED IN THE SOLUTION MUST EXIST IN THE MYSTERY.
  Every person named in solution.method, solution.motive, solution.chain or how_to_deduce must
  appear by that exact name in "characters". Every place must be an investigation_areas name or
  the setting itself. If the chain needs somebody, put them in the cast — never name someone the
  player cannot meet, question or accuse.

DECLARE THE LINKS. Do not leave the connection between a clue and the solution implicit in prose:
state it in fields, so it can be checked without re-reading the story. Each evidence item says
which step of the chain it supports, who it clears, and who it points at.

  ELIMINATION DATA LIVES ONLY ON EVIDENCE. A witness statement, a lead and an investigation area
  do NOT repeat exonerates/implicates -- they carry "reveals", the list of evidence ids they
  surface. Everything a player learns is therefore traceable to an evidence item, and one
  exoneration can never be stated two ways that disagree.

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS — every generated mystery MUST satisfy these:

SETTING:
  - description must explicitly explain why suspects cannot simply leave (isolation mechanic).

CHARACTERS (include 1 victim, EXACTLY 4 suspects, and 3–4 witnesses):
  - FOUR SUSPECTS, COUNTED. Not three, not five. The whole assignment is sized for it: four suspects
    means three people to clear, and with only two the single finding that clears both IS the
    answer, so no assignment can be fair however well the mystery is written. A three-suspect mystery
    is refused outright -- count the list before writing anything else.
  - alibi: SPECIFIC — state where the person was, with whom or doing what. Never "—" or vague.
  - secret: CONCRETE FACT (≥ 2 sentences) anchoring interrogation questions.
  - motive (suspects): specific stake — financial, relational, reputational, or political. Never "—".
  - occupation: always present; must logically place the character in the closed world.
  - pronouns: ALWAYS present, and used CONSISTENTLY everywhere this character is referred to in
    third person — their own bio, statement, secret, alibi, and everywhere else. e.g. "she/her",
    "he/him", "they/them". If the setting or character calls for something else (an invented
    culture, a non-standard convention), write it — this is not a closed list.
  - presentation: ALWAYS present. "human" for an ordinary human character. For anything else —
    an alien, a folkloric creature, an invented species — name what it actually is (e.g.
    "martian", "non-human"), plainly, the same way occupation is free text. This drives which
    portrait art the character gets; a human default costs nothing and a wrong default (forcing
    a non-human character to read as human) is a worse failure than an honest label.
  - bio: 2–3 sentences on WHO THIS PERSON IS, shown to players. Not their function in the puzzle —
    their history, temperament, what they are like to be in a room with, how they came to be here.
    Motive, alibi and secret already carry the mechanics; this is the part that makes a name into a
    person somebody can suspect and feel bad about suspecting. No spoilers: never hint at guilt,
    never restate the secret.
  - statement (WITNESSES ONLY): what this witness tells an investigator who questions them.
    2–4 sentences. It must be ACTIONABLE — it names a person, a place, a time or an object the
    player can do something with. Never atmosphere alone, never "I didn't see anything".
    Witness statements in this build are TRUE. A witness may be mistaken about what something
    MEANT, but must not invent, deny or conceal what they saw. Deception is deliberately switched
    off: a player cannot otherwise tell "this mystery is incoherent" from "this witness lied".
    Across the witnesses as a group, at least one statement must point toward the culprit, and at
    least one must point at something that turns out to be innocent.

    ASSIGN EACH WITNESS A SUSPECT BEFORE WRITING THEIR STATEMENT, and cover every one of the
    four. Write the assignment first -- "this witness is the one who speaks to <suspect>" --
    then write the statement about that person. If there are three witnesses and four suspects,
    one witness covers two; nobody may be left with no one who mentions them.
    THIS IS THE RULE THE LAST THREE GENERATIONS BROKE, and it broke the same way each time: three
    suspects got a witness and a location, and the fourth got a document nobody talks about. That
    fourth suspect then had exactly one route to being cleared -- Adachi, Luz Fontaine, Nadege
    Fontenot -- while the others had four to ten, and each mystery was refused for it. The one
    generation where every suspect had a witness passed this rule outright.
    A suspect nobody mentions is not a lighter workload. It is the defect.

    AND NO SINGLE WITNESS, LEAD OR AREA MAY CARRY A WHOLE PROOF. One finding is assigned to one
    player, so if its "reveals" list adds up to the answer, that player wins without speaking to
    anyone and the sharing decision -- the point of the game -- never happens. Concretely: do not
    let one witness reveal BOTH a narrowing item and the exoneration that completes it. A
    narrowing that leaves two suspects, plus the clue clearing one of them, IS the answer.
    That is how the last generation failed, and it failed while everything else was right:
    one witness revealed the six-foot-shelf narrowing and the barometric log clearing the shorter
    man, and so solved the case single-handed. Split the two halves across different witnesses,
    or put one of them on a lead or an area instead.

    A NARROWING MUST BE A CLASS OF PERSON, NEVER SOMEBODY'S BELONGINGS. Three generations have
    now leaked the answer in a narrowing clue's own prose, and the last one shows why: the clue
    was a vial "in Aoyama's cramped script, found in his entomology kit". Once the object BELONGS
    to one of the people it leaves possible, naming him is unavoidable and the clue has become an
    accusation. Anchor the fact to a physical class instead -- a reach, a handedness, a shoe size,
    a strength, a language read -- so it describes a KIND of person and the player looks at the
    cast and draws the line themselves. A six-foot shelf is a narrowing. A vial in Aoyama's own
    kit is not: it is his name with extra steps.
  - reveals (WITNESSES ONLY): the ids of the evidence items this statement surfaces, e.g. ["E3"].
    EVERY witness must reveal at least one. The statement must actually be about that evidence --
    if a witness saw the bolted door, they reveal the evidence item about the bolted door.
    A witness who reveals nothing is assigned to a player as a finding that cannot be reasoned from.

EVIDENCE (include at least 9 items total — planted to serve the chain, written AFTER it):
  - At least 2 items with type "physical".
  - At least 1 item with relevance "red_herring" and type "physical" or "documentary".
  - At least 2 items with relevance "critical".
  - description: ≥ 2 sentences; state what the item is, where found, and what it suggests.
  - supports: the chain step ids this item is evidence FOR, e.g. ["S2"]. A red herring supports
    nothing and must use [] — it is the only kind of item that may.
  - exonerates: names of suspects this item clears. Use the exact character name.
    AT MOST ONE NAME. One piece of evidence rules out one person, never several at once. An
    item clearing two or three suspects is a solved case in a single object — whoever is assigned it
    wins without anyone sharing anything, which deletes the game. Write the alibi evidence one
    person at a time: each alibi is its own document, witness or trace.
  - implicates: names of suspects this item points AT — SUSPICION, not proof. The culprit must be
    implicated by at least one item; a culprit arrived at only by elimination, with nothing
    positively pointing at them, reads as arbitrary. This is flavour and does not constrain the
    deduction. Do NOT confuse it with "narrows" below.
  - narrows: OPTIONAL, and the most interesting field here. A physical fact that rules people OUT
    without clearing anyone in particular — a bloody MAN'S glove, a boot print in a size only two
    people take, a keycard only the night staff carry. List every suspect who could still be
    responsible given that fact. AT LEAST TWO NAMES, and ALWAYS FEWER THAN THE FULL SUSPECT LIST,
    always including the culprit. With 4 suspects that means 2 or 3 names — never 4. A fact
    consistent with everybody rules nobody out and is not a narrowing clue at all: it reads like
    evidence and does nothing, which is worse than no clue, because a player who works out what it
    implies has been sent down a corridor with no door. If the fact you have written could apply to
    every suspect, sharpen it until it cannot — a rifle is not a narrowing; a LEFT-HANDED shooter
    is — or drop "narrows" from that item.
      * Two or three items should carry it. Most items should not.
      * WRITE THE FACT. NAME NOBODY IT POINTS TO. The description gives the physical detail and
        stops. It must never say "so it was one of the men", never hint a list exists, and — this
        is the one that actually goes wrong — never say that the fact MATCHES a particular person.
        The player looks at the cast and draws the line; that is the whole pleasure, and one name
        destroys it.

        THIS IS THE REAL FAILURE, TAKEN FROM A GENERATION THAT MADE IT. A boot print narrowing to
        two people was written as:

            WRONG: "A partial print, herringbone sole, size 5-6. Morag Gillies wears size 5.5
                    walking boots with a herringbone sole."
            RIGHT: "A partial print in the gear oil, narrower than a work boot — a herringbone
                    walking sole, no bigger than a size 6."

        The wrong one is not a narrowing clue at all. It is an accusation, and whoever is assigned it
        wins without speaking to anyone. Same failure, second example:

            WRONG: "...a woman's voice, low and steady, consistent with how Morag Gillies speaks."
            RIGHT: "...a woman's voice, low and steady, too quiet to place."

        You MAY name a suspect the fact rules OUT — "the print does not match the heavy work boots
        Niall Urquhart wears" is good writing and good play. What you may never do is name anyone
        the fact still leaves possible.
      * IT MUST BE TRUE. If the glove is a man's, the culprit is a man, and no woman wore it. A
        player who reasons exactly as the clue invites must not lose for it — that is the worst
        outcome a mystery can produce, and this rule is M3 Clue Fairness in the craft corpus
        (P.D. James: "the detective can know nothing which the reader isn't also told").
      * The fact must be checkable against the cast: gender, height, build, profession, access,
        handedness — something the character list already tells the player. A narrowing on a fact
        players cannot see is not a clue, it is a coin flip.
      * These are IN ADDITION to the alibi evidence, not instead of it. The case must still be
        solvable by alibis alone, so that withholding a narrowing finding can never make it
        unprovable.
  - Across all items, the suspects exonerated must be every suspect EXCEPT the culprit, so that
    eliminating them leaves exactly one person. Never exonerate the culprit.
  - TWO INDEPENDENT ROUTES, AND WRITE THEM FIRST. Every non-culprit suspect must be cleared by
    AT LEAST TWO separate evidence items, each a genuinely different kind of proof — a witness who
    saw them elsewhere AND a physical trace, not the same fact written twice. A suspect clearable
    only one way becomes unclearable the moment that one item is withheld, and players withhold.

    BUILD THE ARRAY IN THIS ORDER, and do not start the red herrings until the alibi pairs are
    written. With 3 innocents that is six items, and they are the first six:

        E1, E2   both clear <first non-culprit>, by two different kinds of proof
        E3, E4   both clear <second non-culprit>, by two different kinds of proof
        E5, E6   both clear <third non-culprit>, by two different kinds of proof
        E7 …     everything else — red herrings, narrowing facts, items implicating the culprit

    Name the suspect in each of the first six items' "exonerates" before writing its description,
    so the pairing is decided rather than discovered. This ordering is not presentational: it is
    the same reason "solution" is written before the clues. Whatever is emitted first conditions
    everything after, and an alibi structure improvised alongside atmosphere is an alibi structure
    with a gap in it — the last two generations each left exactly one suspect with a single route.
  - Every chain step must appear in at least one item's "supports".
  - REACHABLE: every evidence item that exonerates somebody must be named in the "reveals" of at
    least one witness, lead or investigation area. Not "or found as a clue" -- a clue is always
    available, so that escape clause would make this rule ask for nothing. If every exoneration
    sits on clues alone, witness statements and lead results are decorative and the game has one
    kind of finding wearing three costumes.

SOLUTION (write this FIRST — everything below is derived from it):
  - key_evidence must list at least 2 evidence IDs.
  - chain: the deduction as numbered steps, 3+, each with an id "S1", "S2", … and a one-sentence
    claim. Each step must be a claim a player could actually reach from evidence, not a summary.
    Every step must be supported by at least one evidence item (see EVIDENCE below).
  - how_to_deduce: the same reasoning as readable prose, for the result screen. It must not
    introduce any person, place or fact that is not already in the chain and the cast.
  - The culprit named here must appear in "characters" with role "suspect".

GAMEPLAY NOTES:
  - difficulty: EASY or HARD. There is no MEDIUM — it existed as a third label with no third
    behaviour behind it, which is worse than two honest settings.
  - estimated_playtime: must reflect difficulty — EASY: 30–45 min, HARD: 60–75 min.
    Do not exceed 75 minutes. This is a digital party game, not a dinner-event experience.

INVESTIGATION AREAS (exactly 5):
  - Named physical locations within the setting where players can search for clues.
  - Each area must be atmospherically distinct and plausible for the setting.
  - investigation_prompt: 1–2 sentences of private context Claude will use when a player investigates
    this area (what could be found there — may include red herrings). NOT shown to players.
  - discovery: what a player who searches this area FINDS. 1–2 sentences, concrete and physical —
    an object, a mark, a document, an absence. This is shown to the player verbatim as
    "You searched the <AREA> and found <DISCOVERY>." Every area must yield something; an area
    that yields nothing wastes the only move a player gets there.
  - analysis: what testing, forensics or research on that discovery then reveals. 1–2 sentences,
    shown verbatim as "Testing and research reveal <ANALYSIS>." Make it the kind of thing a lab or
    a records search returns: fingerprints on a weapon match a named person; a bank receipt traces
    to a named account; a hard drive shows what was deleted and when; a ledger entry contradicts a
    stated alibi. It must reference a NAMED character, time or place — not "someone was here".
  - At least 2 areas must yield a discovery+analysis pair that genuinely narrows the suspect list,
    and at least 1 must be a red herring that looks incriminating and is innocently explained.
  - reveals: the ids of the evidence items found here, e.g. ["E1","E7"]. EVERY area must reveal at
    least one, and its discovery/analysis must describe that evidence rather than something else.

LEADS (exactly 4):
  - Pre-existing tips, rumours, or documents that can be followed up on.
  - Each lead must be specific and actionable (not generic like "investigate the crime").
  - investigation_prompt: 1–2 sentences of private context Claude will use to resolve the lead.
    NOT shown to players. At least 1 lead should point toward the culprit; at least 1 is a red herring.
  - reveals: the ids of the evidence items following this lead turns up, e.g. ["E5"]. EVERY lead
    must reveal at least one. The red-herring lead reveals the red-herring evidence item -- that is
    how a dud finding is represented, not by revealing nothing.

    design, cast appearance -- in one response, behind one boolean. Measured on
    the first run that ever executed it, 82% of the output was the video half.
    The owner is deferring video and avatars to stage 3, so the playtest was
    paying for shot direction nobody will read for a year.

    THE VIDEO HALF IS DELETED, NOT PARKED, and the reasoning matters because the
    obvious worry was that tuning this prompt for prose would leave it useless
    for video later. It cannot, because the two never shared anything: the video
    brief was built from the mystery -- title, setting, crime, cast -- never
    from the narration. They were siblings, not a pipeline, so a video brief can
    be written fresh from the mystery dict whenever stage 3 arrives.

    Two more reasons it is a deletion. The old prompt contradicted itself,
    asking for narration with "no camera direction" and, in the same response, a
    brief that is entirely camera direction. And shot-list conventions written
    today are written for today's video models; by stage 3 they are stale, which
    makes writing them now speculative work with a shelf life.

  - NO SPOILERS. Never name or hint at the culprit, the method, or the motive.
  - No camera, shot or lighting direction. This is prose, not a screenplay.

# already generated. A whole game costs exactly what its one generation call
# cost -- which is docs/AI_COST_PLAYBOOK.md's lever pushed all the way.
#
# THE SHARE RULE IS INJECTED, NOT REIMPLEMENTED. _min_share_required() above is
# its only definition; apf.py takes it as a callable and precomputes the ladder
