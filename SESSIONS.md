## Session 4 — March 8, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/document-research-findings-LdlIV`
**Latest commit:** 5e45b91
**Status:** Wrap-up / housekeeping

### What was done
- Validated API key and Anthropic credit balance — pipeline is unblocked and ready
- Diagnosed "no credit" false alarm: was a terminal caching issue; restarting Terminal resolved it
- Confirmed working tree clean, branch up to date with remote — no code changes needed
- No corpus data locally (parquet corpus lives on HuggingFace, not cloned)
- `mystery_database/` is fully synced to git (1 generated mystery + 48-part registry committed)

### Data sync status
| Data | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Code + registry | `claude/document-research-findings-LdlIV` | ✅ Pushed |
| Part taxonomy | `extraction_protocols.py`, `part_registry.py` | ✅ In git |
| Generated mysteries | `mystery_database/generated/` | ✅ Committed (1 file) |
| Corpus (359 books) | HuggingFace `AlekseyKorshuk/mystery-crime-books` | Remote-only, not cloned |
| Extraction outputs (--end 10 run) | Not saved — session ended before commit | ⚠️ Re-run needed |

### Next steps (resume here)
1. Re-run `python3 cli.py extract --protocol P1P2 --end 10` and inspect JSON output quality
2. If quality OK → full run: `python3 cli.py extract --protocol P1P2` (359 books, ~700 new parts)
3. Wire `app.py` to `part_registry.py` (replace freeform LLM generation with part registry RAG)
4. Deploy `app.py` to HuggingFace Spaces

## Session 3 — March 7, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/document-research-findings-LdlIV`
**Latest commit:** d39a3ca
**Status:** Complete

### What was done
- Fixed `corpus_loader.py` — two bugs blocking `python3 cli.py extract --protocol P1P2 --end 10`:
  1. Error message pointed to wrong clone URL (GitHub `Blutomania/mystery-crime-books` has no parquet); corrected to HuggingFace `AlekseyKorshuk/mystery-crime-books`
  2. HuggingFace clones nest the parquet under `data/` subdirectory; loader now checks `data/` first, falls back to repo root
- Extraction pipeline confirmed working — `--end 10` run completed successfully

### Next steps
- Inspect 10 extracted JSON files for P1/P2 field quality before full corpus run
- If quality is good: `python3 cli.py extract --protocol P1P2` (full 359-book run)
- Check API credit balance at console.anthropic.com before full run

## Session 2 — March 7, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/document-research-findings-LdlIV`
**Status:** Active

### What was done
- Committed `RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` — the writer-grounded mystery taxonomy (C1–C6, M1–M8, F1–F12, cross-writer consensus, P1–P4 extraction protocols)
- Built `app.py` — Streamlit UI adapted from the MysterySolver HuggingFace Space:
  - Swapped Groq/Llama for Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
  - Replaced "Generate" button with free-text prompt input
  - Mystery generation structured around P1 Skeleton Protocol (C1–C6)
  - Suspect extraction and solution grounded in P2 Architecture Protocol (M1, M2, M5, M6)
  - Coming Soon panel: AI depiction scenes, multiplayer, clue sharing, Gen AI avatars
- Updated `requirements.txt`: `anthropic>=0.40.0`, `streamlit>=1.35.0`

### Sources for taxonomy
Christie, P.D. James, Ronald Knox, Raymond Chandler, Tana French, Gillian Flynn, Ian Rankin

## Session 1 — March 7, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/mystery-versioning-system-TPblK`
**Status:** Complete (4 commits, latest fd0b320)

### What was built

**`extraction_protocols.py`** — Four-level mystery part taxonomy (P1–P4)

**`test_mysteries.py`** — Canonical test corpus (Mysteries A–F), 6 mysteries × 8 part types = 48 parts

**`part_registry.py`** — Atomization layer (the core missing piece)
- `PART_CONTENT` — text of all 48 parts, keyed by `SOURCE(INDEX)` notation e.g. `C(4)`, `F(2)`, `A(6)`
- `SETTING_COMPAT` — per-part compatibility rules (motives/red herrings universal; biometric/data-log parts require `far_future`; maritime parts require `victorian` or `maritime`)
- `MysteryPart.is_compatible()` — filters candidates against a free-text setting string
- `PartRegistry.sample_for_generation(max_per_source=2)` — diversity-constrained sampling, no single source dominates
- `ProvenanceRecipe.format()` — auditable recipe string stored with every output e.g. `C(1) + C(2) + F(3) + B(4) + A(5) + B(6) + A(7) + E(8)`

**`corpus_loader.py`** — Loads and parses the mystery corpus

**`run_corpus_pipeline.py`** — Extraction runner; delegates to `cli.py extract`

**`cli.py`** — Terminal entry point, 5 commands:
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python cli.py generate` | Interactive mystery generation — setting/crime/players, RAG, mystery + provenance recipe |
| `python cli.py generate --demo` | Same, no API key needed |
| `python cli.py solve` | MysterySolver mode — paste mystery, get structured deduction (culprit, red herrings, next steps) |
| `python cli.py list` | Browse canonical corpus (A–F) and all generated mysteries with recipes |
| `python cli.py registry` | Part inventory: 48 parts, diversity health |
| `python cli.py extract` | Delegates to `run_corpus_pipeline.py` |

**`mystery_database/`** — Committed with initial `part_registry.json` (48 parts) and first demo mystery (`the_murder_at_ancient_athens_…json`) with provenance recipe

**`.gitignore`** — Added; excludes `__pycache__/`, `.env`, `venv`, parquet corpus files, pipeline checkpoints

**`requirements.txt`** — Added `rich>=13.0.0`

### Five gaps closed
| Gap | Solution |
|---|---|
| CLI entry point | `cli.py` with 5 subcommands |
| Explicit part-level decomposition with ID tracking | `MysteryPart` + `PART_CONTENT` in `part_registry.py` |
| Diversity constraint (no single source dominates) | `sample_for_generation(max_per_source=2)` |
| Setting compatibility filter | `SETTING_COMPAT` table + `_parse_setting()` + `is_compatible()` |
| Part provenance tracking | `ProvenanceRecipe` → `C(1) + F(3) + B(6) + …` stored in every JSON |

## Consolidated To-Do List

### Immediate (pre-full corpus run)
- [ ] **Step 6** — Run `python cli.py extract --protocol P1P2 --end 10` to validate extraction quality on 10 books before committing to full 359-book run
- [ ] **Step 7** — Full corpus run: `python cli.py extract --protocol P1P2` — adds ~700 parts to registry, expands setting diversity beyond 6 test mysteries

### UI
- [ ] Wire `app.py` (Streamlit) to `part_registry.py` and `mystery_generator.py` so generated mysteries use the part registry rather than freeform LLM generation
- [ ] Deploy `app.py` to HuggingFace Spaces with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret
- [ ] Revise HuggingFace Spaces UI: confirm text input field is in place (done in Session 2)

### Content & Quality
- [ ] Manual validation of first 10 extracted mysteries before full corpus run
- [ ] Confirm demo mystery output stops using generic Victorian template — requires Step 7 corpus parts for setting-accurate generation (e.g. "Ancient Athens")
- [ ] Update extraction prompts in `mystery_data_acquisition.py` to map to P1–P4 protocol structure

### Architecture
- [ ] Merge `claude/mystery-versioning-system-TPblK` into working branch once Step 6/7 validated
- [ ] Evaluate PostgreSQL + pgvector migration path (trigger: >1,000 mysteries in registry)
