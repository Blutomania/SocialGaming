## Session 28 — August 6, 2026 (coherence engine unification — CYM side)
**Branch:** `claude/coherence-engine-unification` (new, off `main` — this session started on a
Mind Your Friends session (`claude/mind-your-friends-app-tu47of`, `dev/mind-your-friends`-based)
that built a new round rule, then pivoted to scoping MYF's Godot port. That scoping surfaced a
real gap: the "shared Coherence Engine" pillar named in the studio funding pitch didn't actually
exist as running code anywhere — this session's actual work switched to closing that gap on the
CYM side, which needed its own branch off `main` since it's unrelated to the MYF branch's history.)

### Why this happened mid-MYF-session
While comparing CYM's Godot client against what MYF's port would need, found that
`coherence/engine.py` (the `Issue`/`CoherenceReport`/`RuleSet` base classes) existed **only** on
the stranded `dev/mind-your-friends` branch — not on `main` at all — despite MYF's own `CLAUDE.md`
already describing it as an existing cross-title pillar ("Coherence Engine + AI Generation are
named as the two proprietary pillars/moat across all titles" per the studio pitch deck framing).
Neither CYM's `coherence_validator.py` nor MYF's `lib/coherence.js` actually used it. The owner
flagged this as high-priority for funding conversations — it needs to be real, not aspirational.

### Sequencing decision
Owner chose: make it real on CYM first (same language, same repo, contained risk), defer MYF's
side until MYF's own Python port lands (tracked as MYF `CLAUDE.md` item 31/32) rather than either
(a) waiting to build both sides together, or (b) standing up a cross-language JS↔Python bridge as
a stopgap — explicitly rejected as the same premature-integration mistake already flagged in the
existing MYF `CLAUDE.md` note about not wiring the engine before the Godot port replaces the
Next.js client anyway.

### What was built
- Brought `coherence/__init__.py` + `coherence/engine.py` over to `main` (root-level package;
  domain-agnostic `Issue`, `CoherenceReport`, severity constants, abstract `RuleSet.run()`).
- Refactored `coherence_validator.py`:
  - Removed the locally-redefined `Issue` dataclass and `BLOCKING`/`WARNING`/`INFO` constants —
    now imported from `coherence.engine`, the shared vocabulary.
  - `CoherenceReport` here now subclasses the engine's base `CoherenceReport`, adding CYM's
    categorized fields (`p1_issues`, `witness_gaps`, `scene_issues`, `part_issues`). A new
    `__post_init__` keeps the inherited `issues` field in sync as the union of `p1_issues` +
    `scene_issues` + `part_issues` (matching the original `blocking_count`/`warning_count`
    semantics exactly — `witness_gaps` was never counted toward blocking/warning, since witness
    gaps degrade gameplay but don't make a mystery unsolvable, and that's preserved).
  - `check_parts()`'s and `check_mystery()`'s logic moved into two new `RuleSet` subclasses —
    `MysteryPartsRuleSet` (pre-generation) and `MysteryRuleSet` (post-generation) — each with a
    `run(context)` method. The original `check_parts()`/`check_mystery()` functions stay as thin
    wrappers with unchanged signatures, so `server/main.py` (`from coherence_validator import
    check_mystery`) and `deprecated/cli.py` needed zero changes.
  - `WitnessGap` stays CYM-local — not part of the shared vocabulary, since it's a genuinely
    domain-specific shape (character + missing interrogation anchors) that doesn't generalize.
- Updated `docs/WIRING.md`'s "Coherence validator" section to describe the real wiring instead of
  the plain function-based description, and to correct the "shared" framing to state plainly that
  CYM is first, MYF is deferred and why.

### Verification
No existing test suite for this file (checked — none exists). Verified manually:
- `check_mystery()` / `check_parts()` produce identical `passed`/`blocking_count`/`warning_count`/
  issue-list results before and after the refactor, on both a deliberately-broken mystery dict
  (7 blocking + 5 warning issues, matches pre-refactor behavior) and a realistic complete one
  (passes clean, zero issues).
- `MysteryRuleSet().run(mystery)` and `MysteryPartsRuleSet().run(parts)` called directly (the
  actual point of the refactor — real `RuleSet` usage, not just function calls) produce identical
  results to the wrapper functions.
- Confirmed `isinstance(CoherenceReport_instance, coherence.engine.CoherenceReport)` holds, and
  that `report.issues == report.p1_issues + report.scene_issues + report.part_issues` exactly.
- `format_text()` (CYM's richer, category-sectioned override) still renders correctly.
- `server/main.py` and `deprecated/cli.py` still parse/import cleanly with no signature changes.

### Next steps
- MYF's side: once MYF's Godot port lands a Python FastAPI backend, port `lib/coherence.js`'s
  logic into a `RuleSet` subclass in this same `coherence/` package (e.g. a `TriviaRuleSet`),
  living alongside `MysteryRuleSet`/`MysteryPartsRuleSet`. Not started — explicitly deferred.
- This PR/branch has not yet been opened as a pull request — do that next, following the usual
  `main`-rejects-direct-push flow.
- The MYF session that was in progress before this pivot (`claude/mind-your-friends-app-tu47of`)
  is unaffected — its own work (The Lineup round rule) was already committed and pushed separately
  before this branch was created. Godot port scoping (item 31) resumes there once this lands.

## Session 27 — August 4-5, 2026 (git cleanup + anthology ingestion pre-flight, paused mid-run)
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a` (same branch as Session 26 — continued,
not reset, since this session was mostly local-git troubleshooting on the owner's machine rather
than new feature work).
**Status:** Session paused (not closed) at the owner's request, to resume tomorrow. No code
changes this session — entirely git housekeeping plus ingestion pre-flight analysis. One real PR
merged (#12, the story05 data fix that had been sitting uncommitted since Session 23). The 22+
anthology ingestion itself is **mid-run**, not finished — see "Next session should" below.

### What this session actually was
The owner tried to follow Session 26's closing instructions locally and hit a real, multi-step git
blocker chain. Worked through it live, in order:

1. **story05 fix was never actually committed.** Session 23 verified the retry-fix code worked
   against the real failing file, but only the code landed in a commit — the corrected JSON data
   itself sat as an uncommitted local edit on the owner's machine this whole time. Committed it,
   pushed, opened **PR #12**, verified `mergeable_state: clean`, merged
   (`4f0c03c`). This sandbox's branch was fast-forwarded to pick it up too.
2. **Push/pull friction while getting there** — a branch-name typo (commit landed on the current
   branch, not a new one that was never created), a rejected push (remote had commits the local
   machine hadn't fetched — resolved with `git pull --rebase`), and a rebase blocked by 9 unstaged
   file deletions in `new_sources/` (resolved with a scoped `git stash` / `git stash pop` —
   deliberately *not* `-u`, to avoid sweeping in the untracked `mind-your-friends/` project sitting
   in the same repo).
3. **Local `main` had diverged from `origin/main` — turned out to be a stale pre-reconciliation
   clone.** `git log` comparison showed the owner's local `main` was frozen at old
   Streamlit/HuggingFace-era commits (`app.py`, `MAINTENANCE_MODE`, `batch_generate.py`, a "Peter
   Parker trigger") — the exact "stale branch" failure mode `CLAUDE.md`'s July 9 branch-hygiene
   note warns about, just surfacing on `main` itself this time instead of a feature branch.
   Confirmed none of that local-only history was ever pushed (main pushes are blocked repo-wide)
   and that the content it represents is already preserved in `deprecated/` on the real `main`.
   Fixed with `git branch backup-old-local-main` (found one already existed from a prior,
   undocumented occurrence of this same issue — not alarming, just unlabeled history) +
   `git reset --hard origin/main`. Local `main` now correctly matches `origin/main`.

### Duplicate-source triage (before spending any ingestion API cost)
Owner has ~26 new source PDFs staged locally for the next corpus-growth round. Before running
anything, walked the owner through avoiding duplicate extraction spend:
- Cross-referenced the owner's local file list against this sandbox's actual
  `mystery_database/extractions/` contents. Confirmed 4 books were already extracted under
  different filenames: *The Leavenworth Case*, *The Circular Staircase*, *The Greene Murder Case*,
  *The Red House Mystery*. Two of those (*Leavenworth*, *Red House Mystery*) had renamed duplicate
  PDFs sitting in the owner's `new_sources/` that would have silently re-extracted content already
  in the corpus. Owner removed them.
- Wrote a standalone, zero-cost, no-API duplicate checker
  (`check_duplicate_sources.py`, normalized-title word-overlap against every existing extraction's
  `_meta.title`) and handed it to the owner as a scratchpad file — **not committed to the repo**,
  it's a one-off local tool, not part of `scripts/`.
- On a fresh `ls` of the owner's actual `new_sources/`, caught one more, more serious duplicate risk
  the title-matching approach hadn't been run against yet: **`The_Best_of_Mystery_1980_Anthology_-
  _Alfred_Hitchcock.pdf` was still sitting in `new_sources/`** — the exact anthology already fully
  extracted (63/63 stories, Session 21). Re-running it would have burned real API cost re-extracting
  63 already-owned stories and created 63 duplicate `source_id`s. Owner removed it. Confirmed no
  other overlap between the remaining ~24 files and the existing 12-novel + 63-story corpus.
- Two remaining novels (*The Circular Staircase*, *The Greene Murder Case*) were mentioned by the
  owner as "kept" locally but never appeared in any `new_sources/` listing this session — nothing to
  clean up for those two, presumed handled already.
- Confirmed the extraction pipeline genuinely has **zero content-based dedup** — `_slug()` in
  `scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py` derives the output filename purely from the input PDF's own
  filename, so any renamed re-download of an already-extracted source will silently re-extract and
  duplicate. Not fixed this session (would be a real code change, own decision); worth flagging as
  a standing risk for every future ingestion round, not just this one.

### Anthology dry-run findings (21 files in `new_sources/_anthologies/`)
Split the remaining files into `_novels/` (4: *39 Steps*, *Behold, Here's Poison*, *Mystery of the
Chinese Ring*, *Whose Body?*) and `_anthologies/` (21) so each gets the right extraction flag.
`--dry-run --anthology --protocol P1` against the 21 anthologies surfaced real detection-quality
problems worth catching before spending anything:

- **10 clean** — full-book page ranges, real per-story author/title detection, ready to run as-is:
  *Best American Mystery Stories* 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2016, 2017, "215"(2015), "4"
  (Connelly-edited volume), and *Years Best Mystery & Suspense Stories 1993*. ~207 stories total.
  (Minor, non-blocking: 3 of these have one story each double-detected — a contents-listing entry
  plus the real story counted as two separate records; not a cost problem.)
- **5 incomplete** — detector only caught back-matter (an editor's note / "bonus story" section),
  missed the entire main body of stories: Horowitz *Best Crime Stories Vol 4*, Grisham *Best
  Mystery Stories 2025*, Lee Child-edited *2010*, Towles-edited *2023*, Paretsky-edited *2022*.
  Running these as-is would "succeed" while silently throwing away almost the whole book.
- **3 dangerous** — the entire book detected as a single "story," 459K–533K characters each (an
  actual novel-length chunk, not a short story) attributed to one author: an unnamed
  Paretsky-edited volume's story01 specifically (469,713 chars), the 1992 Hoch-edited volume
  (459,548 chars, whole book), and one more Hoch-branded volume with an unclear year in the
  filename (533,566 chars, whole book). Extracting these as single calls would misrepresent an
  entire multi-author anthology as one giant single-author "story" and blow far past the
  short-story-scale cost model the corpus is built around.
- **3 broken/wrong-fit** — McBain-edited *1999* volume detected **0** stories (nothing would be
  extracted at all); Fredric Brown's *Carnival of Crime* detected 1 tiny 2-page fragment, missing
  the rest of the book; Bowden's *Best American Crime Writing 2006* detected 1 "story" that's
  actually the "About the Editors" back-matter — and separately, that volume is nonfiction true-crime
  journalism, not fiction, a taxonomy-fit question independent of the detection bug.

Moved the 10 clean files into `_anthologies/_ready/` and handed the owner the real extraction
command for that subset. **The owner had not yet run it when the session paused** — this is the
literal next action, not a finished step.

### Next session should check
1. Did the owner run `python3 scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py mystery_database/new_sources/_anthologies/_ready --anthology --protocol P1`? All 10/10 succeed?
2. Was `mystery_database/part_registry.json` deleted and regenerated afterward (mandatory —
   `load_registry()` still has no staleness check, per the standing known bug)? Compare new
   source/part counts against this session's last-known baseline (369 sources / 2,833 parts,
   Session 23) plus whatever the 10-file run adds.
3. The `_novels/` batch (4 files) was never even dry-run this session — do that first before
   running it for real.
4. The 11 held-back anthology files are still sitting in `_anthologies/` (not `_ready/`), untouched,
   no cost incurred. Owner needs to decide, file by file, whether to: fix/retry with a different
   heading-detection approach, extract individually with hand-tuned settings, or skip. Not urgent,
   but don't let it get lost — it's roughly half the batch.
5. `check_duplicate_sources.py` (scratchpad-only, not in the repo) is worth re-running any time a
   fresh batch of source PDFs shows up — it isn't a one-time fix, it's a standing pre-flight habit
   given the pipeline's confirmed lack of real dedup.

## Session 26 — August 4, 2026 (new game-flow features, in progress)
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a` (reset fresh from `main` at the top of
this session, per Session 25's own recommendation)
**Status:** Session closed clean. All 3 room/reveal/vote pieces plus the follow-up craft-grounding
pass on the resolution narrative are built, verified, and merged into `main` (PR #9, PR #10).
Branch reset to `main`'s tip, no open PRs, no uncommitted changes. A 22-anthology ingestion cycle
was discussed and guidance handed to the owner to run locally, but **not executed this
session** — see the closing note below for exactly what the next session needs to check first.

### New scope this session
Owner proposed three new features in one design conversation:
1. **Prompt-suggestion round at game start** — every player suggests a mystery prompt idea; the
   host's own suggestion is what actually gets played, and everyone else's stay stored for later.
2. **End-of-game resolution as a social moment** — explicitly **all generative-AI video tabled for
   now** (cost-consciousness + "design the look and feel first" — a `"Video Scene Will Play Here"`
   placeholder stands in for it): reveal the mystery's plot/narrative, show the winning player's
   own uncovered findings, then move into voting for the next mystery.
3. **Post-game voting** — surface the prompts submitted in (1) that weren't used, let the group
   vote (or the winner pick) for next time. Owner noted this should "subtly" encourage the same
   group to reconvene — implies the room itself should be reusable across mysteries rather than
   forcing a fresh room/rejoin each time (not designed in detail yet).

### Piece 1 built and verified: room-first lobby + prompt collection
Found a real architecture mismatch while scoping this: `POST /games/create` required a
`mystery_slug` — a mystery had to exist *before* a room could exist, which is backwards from "the
room is open, players suggest prompts while waiting." Confirmed the fix with the owner before
touching it (this changes an existing endpoint's contract, not a purely additive change) — chose
"room first, generate on start" over the lower-risk "keep old flow, log suggestions as cosmetic
only" alternative, since only the room-first version actually delivers what the owner described.

**What changed** (`server/main.py`):
- `POST /games/create` — `mystery_slug` is now optional. Omitted (the new normal path): room opens
  with `mystery: None`. Given (unchanged): quick-start path for local testing, mystery attached
  immediately, no prompt collection.
- New `POST /games/{id}/prompts/submit` — any player (host included) suggests a prompt;
  resubmitting overwrites their own entry. Rejected once the mystery already exists.
- `POST /games/{id}/start` — now branches: if `mystery` is already attached (quick-start path),
  behaves exactly as before (broadcasts `game_started` immediately). Otherwise, reads the **host's
  own** submission from `submitted_prompts`, 400s if the host hasn't submitted one yet, and kicks
  off generation in a background thread, returning `{status: "generating", job_id}`.
- New `_run_generation_pipeline()` — extracted the actual generate → localize → check-coherence →
  optional-cinematic-brief → save pipeline out of the existing `/generate/async` job runner, so
  both the plain job path and the new game-attached path (`_run_game_generation_job()`) share it
  with zero duplicated logic. The game-attached version's only difference: once the pipeline
  finishes, it attaches the result to `game["mystery"]` and broadcasts `mystery_ready` (or
  `mystery_generation_failed`) instead of just marking a job done.
- `GET /games/{id}/mystery-brief` and `GET /games/{id}/lobby` — both used to assume
  `game["mystery"]` always exists and would crash on `None`. `mystery-brief` now 400s with a clear
  "not yet generated" message; `lobby` returns `title`/`setting` as `null` plus a new
  `submitted_prompt_count` and per-player `has_submitted_prompt`, so a waiting-room UI has
  something real to render.

**Verified end-to-end**, not just written: a stubbed-LLM `TestClient` run through the full sequence
(create room-first → confirm `lobby.title` is `null` → join a second player → both submit prompts →
confirm a non-host `start` attempt 403s → host `start` → poll the job to `done` → confirm
`lobby.title` matches the **host's** prompt, not the other player's) plus edge cases (starting
before any prompt submitted → 400; `mystery-brief` before generation → 400, not a crash; resubmitting
a prompt overwrites rather than duplicates). Full app still loads cleanly, 34 routes (up from 33).
Documented in `docs/WIRING.md` → "Room-first lobby flow."

### Piece 2 built and verified: end-of-game resolution reveal (zero new AI calls)
`server/main.py`:
- New `_format_plot_reveal(mystery)` — reshapes the mystery's own `solution` (already generated
  once at mystery creation) into `{culprit, method, motive, how_to_deduce, key_evidence}`, resolving
  `solution.key_evidence`'s bare evidence IDs into full `{id, name, description}` objects so the
  reveal can name what was found, not just cite `"E1"`. Pure formatting, no API call.
- New `_winner_findings_summary(game, winner_id)` — the winning player's own
  `witness_findings`/`investigation_findings`/`lead_findings`, exactly as collected during play.
  Deliberately shown to the whole room, not kept private — the point is the shared reveal of *how*
  they got there. Also zero API cost, pure data shaping.
- New `_build_resolution_reveal(game, winner_id)` — thin shared wrapper so the `game_won` broadcast
  and `GET /games/{id}/result` return the identical reveal shape; both now include `plot_reveal` and
  `winner_findings` alongside the existing `solution`/`winner_name` fields.
- Video stays a **client-side placeholder only** (`"Video Scene Will Play Here"`) — no backend
  field, no dormant prompt-builder code added since there's nothing yet to point it at. Documented
  in `docs/WIRING.md` what a future `_generate_resolution_video_brief()` would reuse (`plot_reveal`'s
  already-resolved content) if/when video work gets un-tabled, without actually building it now.

**Verified end-to-end**, not just written: extended the piece-1 stubbed-LLM test through a full
game — host investigates an area (finding injected directly into game state, since the
investigate-area endpoint's own phase-gating is pre-existing code, not what this test targets),
accuses correctly, wins — then confirmed `GET /result` returns `plot_reveal.culprit == "Bob"`,
evidence IDs correctly resolved to names (`"Knife"`, `"Note"`), `how_to_deduce` text intact, and
`winner_findings.investigation_findings` contains the exact finding recorded during play. Full app
still loads cleanly, still 34 routes (extended existing endpoints, added no new ones). Documented in
`docs/WIRING.md` → "End-of-game resolution reveal."

### Piece 3 built and verified: post-game voting + same-room replay
Owner's decision on the vote mechanic: **group vote, winner breaks ties — except when that same
winner also won the mystery right before this one, in which case tie-break passes to a random pick
instead** ("I don't want the same winner to keep picking"). Zero AI calls throughout — tallying is
pure Python, same discipline as piece 2.

**What changed** (`server/main.py`):
- New session fields: `used_prompt_player_id` (whose submission drove the currently-attached
  mystery — set by `start_game`/the next-mystery flow) and `win_history` (one winner `player_id`
  per mystery played in this room, oldest first — exists solely to answer "did the current winner
  also win last time" for the tie-break rule).
- New `round_type: "prompt_vote"`, registered into the existing `_ROUND_PREP`/`_ROUND_GENERATORS`
  dispatch (piece 3 is the second thing to ever use that extension point, after `"witness"` —
  confirms the round system genuinely generalizes, not just witness-shaped):
  - `_prompt_vote_prep()` — candidates are `submitted_prompts` minus whoever's drove this game.
  - `_tally_prompt_vote()` — counts votes, majority wins outright; on a tie, checks
    `win_history[-1] == game["winner"]` to decide between "winner picks" (sets
    `awaiting_tiebreak_from`, leaves `chosen_player_id` null) and "auto-resolve randomly" (repeat
    winner, or the tie doesn't even include the winner's own candidate).
  - `submit_round()` gained a `prompt_vote` validation branch (vote must name an actual candidate),
    following the same per-round-type dispatch pattern the `witness` branch already used.
- New `POST /games/{id}/prompts/tiebreak` — resolves an `awaiting_tiebreak_from` result; rejects
  the auto-resolved case (nothing to confirm), enforces caller == the named authority, validates
  the choice is actually one of the tied candidates.
- New `POST /games/{id}/next-mystery/start` (host only) — the "same room persists across
  mysteries" mechanic the owner called out as the actual point (subtly keeping the same group
  together rather than forcing a fresh room each time). `_reset_game_for_next_mystery()` appends
  the concluded winner to `win_history`, clears every mystery-scoped field (mystery, stage, round,
  winner, accusations, both pools, every player's phase/budgets/findings), and re-triggers
  `_run_game_generation_job()` (piece 1's machinery, unchanged) from the voted prompt — same
  `game_id`, same players, nobody rejoins.

**Verified end-to-end**, not just written:
- Full API happy path: 3-player game → win → open `prompt_vote` → confirmed candidates correctly
  exclude the used prompt → clear-majority vote (2-1) → `next-mystery/start` → polled the
  regeneration job to `done` → confirmed `win_history == [original_winner]`, `winner` reset to
  `None`, players' `investigation_findings` back to `[]`, `submitted_prompts` cleared, and the
  *new* mystery (`"Test Mystery 2"`, second stubbed-LLM response) actually attached — not a stale
  copy of the first.
- Direct unit coverage of `_tally_prompt_vote()`'s branch logic (bypassing the multi-player API
  dance for cases hard to construct via real votes): clear majority; tie with a non-repeat winner
  → `awaiting_tiebreak_from` set correctly; tie with a repeat winner → auto-resolved random,
  correct `reason` text; tie that excludes the winner's own candidate entirely → also
  auto-resolved; single-candidate trivial case.
- `/prompts/tiebreak` authorization: non-authority player rejected (403), invalid
  `chosen_player_id` rejected (400), correct authority succeeds and sets `tie_broken_by`,
  double-resolution attempt rejected (400).
- Full app still loads cleanly, 36 routes (up from 34 — the two new endpoints; `prompt_vote`
  itself added no new route since it reuses the existing generic round endpoints). Documented in
  `docs/WIRING.md` → "Post-game prompt voting and same-room replay."

### All three pieces of this feature set are now done
Prompt-suggestion round (piece 1) → end-of-game plot/findings reveal (piece 2) → post-game vote +
same-room replay (piece 3) form one complete loop, each built and verified incrementally per the
owner's explicit request, all pushed to the same branch for review.

### Piece 2 revisited: craft-grounded resolution narrative (one new AI call, explicitly approved)
Owner asked to wire craft best-practices into the plot reveal to make it "as entertaining and
apropos to the scenario, and fun as possible." Flagged the real fork this created against the
earlier "table all gen AI" instruction — zero-cost restructuring of the existing fields vs. an
actual AI-authored narrative — and asked before building either way. Owner chose the AI-authored
option explicitly, un-tabling gen AI for this one call specifically (video generation stays
tabled).

**What got built** (`server/main.py`, `craft_grounding.py`):
- New `CALL_SITE_TAGS["resolution_reveal"]` — the RAG layer's fifth call-site, after the original
  four from Session 22. Tagged `C5` (The Resolution) + `M6` (The Reveal Mechanic) +
  `"Accusation/Reveal Phase"`. Verified the retrieval pool directly before wiring anything: 19
  matching entries, including real craft findings like Rian Johnson's "a reveal must feel earned,
  not just correct" and Moffat's "the controlled release of information... is really, really
  hard" (both `SCREEN_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md`) — genuinely on-topic, not just definitional filler.
- Noticed the default `max_items=5` ranking (confidence-tier first, then alphabetical-by-concept
  tiebreak) buries both of those specific findings well outside the top 5 for this query, given
  how large the matching pool is here compared to the other four call-sites. Chose **not** to
  touch the shared ranking/tiebreak logic itself (explicitly called out in `craft_grounding.py`'s
  own docstring as a deliberate design decision, not a default) — instead used `max_items=8` as a
  per-call budget for this one call-site only, documented as such.
- New `_generate_resolution_narrative()` — one Claude call, prompt built from `plot_reveal` +
  `winner_findings` (both already-resolved, no need to touch raw `mystery` a second time),
  explicitly forbidden from inventing facts not already in those two inputs.
- `_build_resolution_reveal()` now generates the narrative **once** (only if
  `game["resolution_narrative"]` is still `None`) and caches it — `GET /result` never regenerates
  on a later fetch, so a reconnecting client sees the identical wording, not a fresh (and
  differently-phrased) LLM roll each time. Craft-guidance provenance stashed server-side only
  (`game["_resolution_craft_guidance"]`), matching every other call-site's audit-trail treatment.
  Both cache fields added to `_reset_game_for_next_mystery()`'s clear list from piece 3, so the
  next mystery in the same room gets its own fresh narrative.

**Real bug found and fixed while building this, not left in:** `_winner_findings_summary()`
(piece 2, from earlier this session) had been returning `investigation_findings`/`lead_findings`
raw, including their `_craft_guidance` key — internal audit citations that are safe to return
per-player from `investigate-area`/`follow-lead` (those calls are private) but were about to leak
to the **whole room** via `winner_findings`, which is deliberately broadcast. Exactly the kind of
leak `_resolve_round()` was built to prevent for witness rounds, just missed in piece 2. Fixed by
stripping `_craft_guidance` from each finding before returning.

**Verified end-to-end**, not just written: confirmed the craft guidance block actually appears in
the real prompt text sent to the (stubbed) LLM, not just that retrieval ran; confirmed exactly one
LLM call happens per win (not per `GET /result` fetch); confirmed a second `GET /result` call
makes zero additional LLM calls and returns byte-identical narrative text; confirmed the
`_craft_guidance` leak fix directly (asserted the key is absent from `winner_findings` in the
response); confirmed `_resolution_craft_guidance` never appears in any client-facing response
while still being present server-side for audit. Full app still loads cleanly, 36 routes (no new
endpoints — extended `_build_resolution_reveal()` in place). Documented in `docs/WIRING.md`
(rewritten "End-of-game resolution reveal" section, extended call-site table now covering five
sites, "Status" line updated) and `CLAUDE.md` item 10 (four → five call-sites) and new item 15.

### What is next
- Godot client work for all three room/reveal/voting pieces (waiting-room UI showing
  prompt-submission progress, the resolution screen with the video placeholder panel and the new
  narrative text, the vote/tiebreak UI) — none of this session's backend work has touched Godot.
- Video generation itself remains explicitly tabled, per the owner's own repeated instruction —
  not a forgotten item, a deliberate one.

### Session close: PR #9 and #10 both merged, plus a live ingestion-planning discussion (not executed)
Both feature PRs from this session merged clean into `main` — `f4af3c9` → `6ca36e4` (PR #9: the
three-piece room/reveal/vote loop) → `0b3b078` (PR #10: the craft-grounded resolution narrative).
Branch reset to `main`'s tip after each merge, per the established pattern; confirmed clean at
session close (`git status` empty, branch is an exact, non-diverged match to `origin/main`).

Before closing, the owner raised a **new corpus-ingestion cycle**: 22 more anthology PDFs staged
locally, not yet in this repo's `mystery_database/new_sources/`. This was pure discussion/guidance
this session — **no code was written or changed for it, and no extraction has run yet.** Three
things were covered, all now also cross-referenced in `CLAUDE.md` item 7:

1. **Readiness assessment.** Anthology-extraction *mechanics* (splitting, the Session 23
   retry/silent-failure fix, the source_id collision fix) are solid, but flagged two real caveats
   rather than a clean "yes": the heading-detection heuristic has only ever been validated against
   **one** real anthology (the already-ingested Hitchcock collection) — the other 21 are unproven
   against it, so `--dry-run` per file isn't optional here, it's the only check that exists before
   spending real API calls. And `part_registry.json`'s known staleness bug (item 14, still
   unfixed) means newly-ingested content won't actually be usable by generation until the registry
   cache is manually deleted and regenerated afterward — easy to forget, already bit this project
   once (frozen since March until Session 23 caught it).
2. **Cost estimate**, computed from real numbers rather than guessed: replayed the actual
   already-ingested "Pseudo Identity" story (22,758 chars) through the real prompt template to get
   genuine token counts, then priced against the script's actual default model (Haiku 4.5,
   $1/$5 per MTok) — **~$0.009/story at P1 depth, ~$0.019/story at P1P2**. Total for 22
   anthologies estimated at **~$3–$17** depending on stories-per-anthology (highly variable; the
   one known data point, 63 stories, may be on the high end for a "Best of the Year" annual
   volume vs. a themed collection) — recommended `--dry-run` across all 22 first to replace the
   estimate with an exact count before spending anything.
3. **Exact terminal commands** handed to the owner to run locally: sync to `main` first (this
   session's field-mapping/axis-rename fixes need to be present) → `--anthology --dry-run` across
   the whole `new_sources/` directory (free) → real extraction at either `--protocol P1` (cheaper,
   matches all 75 existing sources) or `--protocol P1P2` (owner's choice, full 8-axis registry
   coverage for just these 22, ~2x cost) → **the registry regeneration step** (`rm
   part_registry.json` + reload) called out explicitly as the step most likely to get forgotten →
   a final count check against `mystery_database/extractions/`.

**Next session should check, in this order:** (1) did the 22-anthology ingestion actually run
locally — ask if unclear, don't assume; (2) if it ran, how many of the 22 succeeded vs. got
skipped/errored (dry-run anomalies, non-anthology files mixed into the folder, etc.); (3) was the
registry regenerated afterward — compare current source/part counts against the last known
baseline (369 sources / 2,833 parts, Session 23, itself already possibly stale by then) to confirm
growth actually landed; (4) which depth (P1 vs P1P2) was actually used, since that determines
whether the new sources close the "STILL OPEN" axis-coverage gap in `CLAUDE.md` item 12 or just
extend it; (5) the still-untriaged `The_Devotion_of_Suspect_X` (Higashino) and the 3 queued novels
in `new_sources/` remain exactly as open as before — this session's discussion didn't touch them.

## Session 25 — August 3, 2026 (reconciliation)
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a`
**Starting commit:** `dbe849d` (tip after Session 24's reconciliation merge)
**Status:** Complete — reconciled a handoff doc from yet another concurrent session against real
GitHub state (found it was partially stale), then closed the one real open risk it surfaced

### Multi-session branch confusion, resolved by checking GitHub directly instead of trusting either account
The owner pasted a handoff doc from a session that had been working on this same branch,
warning that PR #7 was still open and undecided, and that PR #8 (containing the Session 23 axis-
mislabeling/field-mapping fix) needed review before any branch reset. Checked actual GitHub state
rather than trusting either account: **PR #7 was in fact already merged** (`0e39e93`, merge commit
visible in `git log origin/main`) — that must have happened after the handoff was written. PR #8
(`dbe849d`, exactly the Session 23 commit) was confirmed `mergeable_state: "clean"` against current
`main`, 7 files changed, matching expectations exactly — no surprise content.

### The one real, unresolved risk from the handoff: checked, found latent not live, fixed anyway
The handoff's sharpest claim: `craft_grounding.py` (RAG layer, Session 22) is "actively wiring
`PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md` content into all four generation call-sites right now," and a full-text
verification pass (done in that other session, never written into the doc — "only exists in this
session's conversation history") found that Steven Medway's *Blood on the Clocktower* design
assumes team-based cooperation ("work together to build a team that agrees with you"), which
structurally conflicts with this game's individually-competitive, first-to-solve accusation design.
Framed as something that "should be checked/fixed before the RAG layer is trusted further."

Rather than trying to reconstruct another session's lost conversation (not possible — no session
has access to another session's transcript), verified the actual risk empirically against the real
retrieval code:
- Ran `get_craft_guidance()` with the exact `CALL_SITE_TAGS` used by all three fixed call-sites
  and inspected the real top-5 (post confidence-tier ranking) that would actually get injected.
  The Clocktower "team consensus" row (tagged `Accusation/Reveal Phase`, `75% Sharing Mechanic`)
  is not reachable by any of the three currently-wired call-sites (`witness_scene`,
  `investigate_area`, `follow_lead`) — none of them request those two game-system tags.
- Confirmed `_generate_mystery_dict()` can't reach `PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md` content at all today:
  it only queries by taxonomy codes (`PART_TYPE_TO_TAXONOMY`), and 38 of that doc's 39 parsed
  entries have empty `taxonomy_tags` (that doc uses game-system tags instead, per its own stated
  design).
- **So: not currently live.** But a real latent risk — the moment any future call wires in an
  `Accusation/Reveal Phase` tag (the end-game resolution scene, unblocked and next on the roadmap,
  is exactly that kind of call), this row's raw "work together" framing would surface unmodified.

**Fixed at the row level, not just in doc prose**, so the fix travels with the content wherever
it's retrieved rather than relying on a future reader noticing a warning elsewhere: confirmed via
`format_guidance_block()` that only a row's `concept` + `insight` text ever reaches a live prompt
(the "Maps to game system" column is parsed for tags only, never injected) — so added an explicit
`DIVERGENCE` caveat directly into the Medway "Storyteller's chaos" row's Insight text in
`PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md`, naming the real endpoint (`POST /games/{id}/accuse`, first-correct-
guess-wins-alone) and instructing that the *triangulating partial info* insight transfers but the
*team* framing must not. Verified directly: rebuilt the index, confirmed `"DIVERGENCE"` and
`"individually competitive"` are present in the row's actual `.insight` field post-parse — not
just in the markdown source. Also strengthened the existing "Win Condition Design as a live
tension" flagged-concept note to record this as a confirmed structural conflict, not just a tonal
one, and point back to the row-level fix.

### Files modified
- `PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md` — divergence caveat added to the Medway "Storyteller's chaos" row and
  the "New concepts flagged" section

### What is next
- PR #8 (now carrying this fix too) ready to merge — clean against current `main`.
- Per the handoff's own recommendation: once merged, start a fresh branch off `main` for further
  work rather than continuing to accumulate on this one (multiple concurrent sessions have now
  landed work here; time to close it out).
- End-game resolution scene / knowledge-comparison screen — both unblocked, not built.
- `The_Devotion_of_Suspect_X` triage decision — still the owner's to make.

## Session 24 — August 3, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a`
**Starting commit:** `a90ded7` (tip after Session 21 — same base Session 22/23 branched from;
this work happened in parallel with those two, not aware of them until merge time)
**Status:** Complete — built the multiplayer accusation-resolution backend (Session 21's item
1 next-step), then reconciled with Session 22/23's work landing on the same branch concurrently

### Accusation-resolution backend
Closed the gap Session 21 identified: no backend endpoint existed anywhere for resolving a
multiplayer accusation. Added `POST /games/{id}/accuse` (server-authoritative check against
`mystery["solution"]["culprit"]`, which is never sent to clients; first correct accusation wins;
race-safe via `_games_lock` re-checked at the moment of the winning claim, not just an early
gate) and `GET /games/{id}/result` (snapshot for a client that missed the broadcast). New fields
`game["winner"]` / `game["accusations"]`. Two new broadcasts: `accusation_made` (every attempt,
right or wrong, public to the whole room — explicit owner decision, matches the party-craft
research on shared wrong-guess moments) and `game_won` (full solution reveal, the trigger point
for the still-unbuilt end-game resolution scene). Wrong guesses are non-eliminating.

**Verified, not just written:** wrong-guess/correct-guess/post-solve-rejection flow through real
FastAPI `TestClient` HTTP calls; late-join `/result` snapshot before and after a win; and
specifically the race condition — fired 3 simultaneous correct accusations from 3 players in
real threads, confirmed exactly 1 won and the other 2 were correctly rejected as already-solved,
not just checked in the easy sequential case. `docs/WIRING.md` documents the new endpoints.

### Merge reconciliation with Session 22/23
Pushing this work hit a non-fast-forward rejection — Session 22 (RAG craft-grounding retrieval
layer, built on `_generate_witness_scene` from Session 21) and Session 23 (extraction
silent-failure fix) had both landed on this same branch in the meantime. Merged rather than
force-pushing; `server/main.py`, `docs/WIRING.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` auto-merged cleanly (no
functional overlap — different call-sites and files respectively). Only this log file conflicted,
resolved by discarding a content-free auto-chore stub in favor of proper session entries on both
sides.

### What is next
Unchanged from Session 22/23's lists, plus: the accusation backend now unblocks the end-game
resolution/summation scene (Session 21's tracked item, still open).

---

## Session 23 — August 3, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a` (continued from Session 22, same branch —
PR #7 already open against it)
**Starting commit:** `1b6ae7c` (tip after Session 22)
**Status:** Complete — two fixes: (1) silent extraction-failure bug found while reviewing the
Session 20 anthology output, verified against the real failing case; (2) extraction-pipeline
field-mapping gap from Session 22's audit, plus the `evidence_type`/`alibi` axis mislabeling it
collided with

### Bug found: silent JSON-parse failure indistinguishable from a genuine "nothing found"
While reviewing extracted anthology content per the owner's request, found
`pdf_the_best_of_mystery_1980_antho__story05_pseudo_identity.json` ("Pseudo Identity" by Lawrence
Block) had come back with all 6 P1 fields null — including `crime` and `investigator`, fields
essentially always present in any mystery. The same author's other story in the anthology
extracted cleanly. Root cause: `extract_pdf()` and `extract_pdf_anthology()` both caught
`json.JSONDecodeError` on a malformed Claude response and silently wrote the same null-placeholder
shape Claude itself uses for a legitimately-absent element — so a hard parse failure and an honest
"not in this text" result were byte-for-byte identical in the saved file. No warning, no log line,
nothing to distinguish them without manually cross-checking against a sibling extraction.

### Fix: shared retry helper, loud warnings, failure-mode split
Added `_call_claude_for_protocol()` in `scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py`, replacing the duplicated
inline call+parse blocks in both `extract_pdf()` and `extract_pdf_anthology()`:
- A malformed response now retries once before falling back to the placeholder.
- If the retry also fails to parse, the placeholder is still saved (a formatting quirk isn't
  expected to self-resolve on a bare re-run), but now **with a warning** recorded in
  `_meta.extraction_warnings` and printed to console — no longer silent.
- Pure API-call failures (network/auth/rate-limit — never got a response back at all) are handled
  differently on purpose: raises `ExtractionAPIError`, and the caller skips the source entirely
  rather than saving anything. This preserves the original (safer) behavior for that failure mode —
  the dedup-by-filename check on a later re-run will retry it naturally, instead of a transient
  network hiccup permanently marking the source "done."

### Verified against the real failing case, not just stubs
Stub-tested first (3 scenarios: retry-succeeds, always-malformed, pure-API-failure — all correct).
Then the owner ran it for real locally: deleted the story05 output file and re-ran
`python3 scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py ".../The_Best_of_Mystery_1980_Anthology_-_Alfred_Hitchcock.pdf" --anthology --protocol P1`.
Console showed the mechanism firing exactly as designed — first attempt hit
`JSON parse failed (Expecting ',' delimiter: line 5 column 48 (char 266))`, printed a `WARNING`
with a preview of the bad raw response, retried, and the retry succeeded. The saved file now has
real, high-confidence, coherent values across all 6 fields (confirmed by the owner pasting the
final JSON) with no `extraction_warnings` key — a clean save, not a warned placeholder. Bug
confirmed fixed against the actual data that originally exposed it.

### Files modified
- `scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py` — `_call_claude_for_protocol()` + `ExtractionAPIError`, both
  extraction entry points updated to use it (commit `5dee1cd`)

### Decision
This fix only addresses the extraction call/parse robustness gap. It does not touch the two
extraction-pipeline efficiency gaps from Session 22 (registry field-mapping mismatch;
P1-only-source depth) — those remain open, separate decisions.

### What is next
- Owner has more anthologies to extract; this fix is now live for all of them.
- Owner still needs to triage remaining `mystery_database/new_sources/` files (3 queued novels,
  1 unsupported `.html`, the untriaged Higashino novel).
- The extraction-pipeline efficiency gap's second half (P1-only sources still missing 3 of 8
  axes) — see below, this remains open.

### Continued this session: extraction-efficiency field-mapping fix + axis mislabeling fix
Owner asked to address open issues next. Picked up Session 22's first efficiency-gap fix
(`part_registry.py` discarding 6 extracted-but-unread fields) — while scoping it, found it
collides with a documented caveat already sitting in `craft_grounding.py`'s docstring: the
registry's axis 8 is named `"evidence_type"` but actually holds alibi content (the extraction key
`"alibi"` maps there), and the docstring explicitly warns not to extend that axis's mapping
without fixing the mislabeling first — doing one without the other would blend unrelated craft
concepts under one mistagged axis. Asked the owner how to handle it; answer: **"Definitely fix the
mislabelling too. Keep it clean."**

**What got fixed, in one pass:**
1. **Axis rename**: `part_registry.py`'s `PART_TYPE_NAMES[7]` renamed from `"evidence_type"` to
   `"alibi"` (`SETTING_COMPAT` key renamed to match).
2. **Field-mapping extended**: `_atomize_extraction()`'s `KEY_TO_IDX` now maps the 5 previously-
   discarded fields with honest semantic fits — `victim`→motive (idx 3, alongside
   `culprit_and_motive`), `resolution`→reveal_mechanic (idx 6, alongside `reveal_mechanic` itself
   — P1's shallow version of the same P2 concept), `investigator` + `investigator_wound`→
   social_dynamic (idx 7), `clue_fairness`→red_herring (idx 5, paired as "clue economy" — both
   axes govern how information reaches the reader, from opposite ends). `media_and_audience` (P2)
   deliberately left unmapped — meta/format information, no honest fit among the 8 crime-mechanic
   axes.
3. **`craft_grounding.py` updated to match**: `PART_TYPE_TO_TAXONOMY`'s `"evidence_type": ["M5"]`
   → `"alibi": ["M5"]`; the module docstring's "KNOWN CAVEAT" section replaced with a short
   "RESOLVED CAVEAT" note pointing here.
4. **`coherence_validator.py` updated** — this was the one live dependency that would have
   silently broken: `check_parts()`'s completeness check and its "scene investigation must be
   scene-observable" check (section 3) both hardcoded the string `"evidence_type"` as a
   `by_type` dict key. Since parts now carry `part_type="alibi"`, those checks would have quietly
   stopped firing (the `if "evidence_type" in by_type` branch never true) without this rename — 4
   call sites fixed (the two `by_type` lookups, plus two repair-hint strings in `check_mystery()`
   that reference `part_type='evidence_type'` by name).
5. **`docs/WIRING.md`** — the "Known caveat baked into `PART_TYPE_TO_TAXONOMY`" section rewritten
   as a resolved note.

**Verified, not just written:**
- `_atomize_extraction()` tested directly against a synthetic extraction dict covering all 14
  P1+P2 keys: confirmed 13 parts produced (not 14 — `media_and_audience` correctly excluded),
  landing on the correct axes, including two-per-axis pooling (`motive` got both
  `culprit_and_motive` and `victim`; `social_dynamic` got `investigator`, `social_world`, and
  `investigator_wound`).
- `craft_grounding.PART_TYPE_TO_TAXONOMY` confirmed to have `"alibi"` and not `"evidence_type"`.
- `server/main.py` still imports cleanly and serves all 31 routes (its `_craft_guidance_for_parts`
  helper does a plain `.get(p.part_type, [])` lookup, so the rename required zero changes there).
- `sample_for_generation()` + `coherence_validator.check_parts()` run end-to-end against the real
  rebuilt registry: sampled recipe included an `alibi` part, `report.passed == True`.
- Grepped the whole live codebase (excluding `deprecated/` and historical `mystery_database/
  generated/*.json` snapshots, which correctly keep their old field name as a point-in-time
  record) for stray `"evidence_type"` references — none left outside explanatory prose in resolved
  caveat notes.

**Second bug found and fixed along the way, unrelated to the mislabeling but same root cause
category (silent staleness):** `mystery_database/part_registry.json` is a checked-in cache that
`load_registry()` only rebuilds if the file is *missing* — never if it's *stale*. It had been
frozen since March 11 (294 sources), silently missing ~75 sources' worth of corpus growth since
then, including all 63 anthology stories from Session 20. Deleted and let `load_registry()`
rebuild it fresh (369 sources, 2,833 parts — up from 1,469). The underlying staleness-check gap is
**not** fixed, only the immediate staleness; flagged as a follow-up in `CLAUDE.md` item 14.

### Files modified
- `part_registry.py` — axis rename, `SETTING_COMPAT` key rename, `KEY_TO_IDX` extended
- `craft_grounding.py` — `PART_TYPE_TO_TAXONOMY` key rename, docstring caveat resolved
- `coherence_validator.py` — 4 call sites renamed from `"evidence_type"` to `"alibi"`
- `docs/WIRING.md` — caveat section rewritten as resolved
- `mystery_database/part_registry.json` — regenerated (stale cache, see above)

### What is next
- The extraction-pipeline efficiency gap's remaining half: P1-only sources still populate only 5
  of 8 axes (up from 3) — full 8-axis coverage needs `--protocol P1P2` re-extraction, which is a
  new-API-cost decision still open.
- `load_registry()`'s missing staleness check (CLAUDE.md item 14) — real fix needed, not done this
  session.
- Everything else from Session 22's "What is next" list remains open and untouched.

## Session 22 — July 31, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a`
**Starting commit:** `a90ded7` (tip after Session 21)
**Status:** Complete — extraction-pipeline efficiency audit, deck-terminology naming discussion,
and the RAG craft-grounding retrieval layer built and wired into all four relevant generation
call-sites

### Extraction efficiency audit (led to this session's build)
Asked directly whether the extraction pipeline is actually feeding the coherence engine enough
to produce coherent NPC dialogue, now that Session 21 rebuilt how that dialogue gets generated.
Traced the real code path and found two concrete, verified gaps:
1. **Depth mismatch drops 5 of 8 registry axes for every P1-only source.** `part_registry.py`'s
   `_atomize_extraction()` expects P2-tier keys (`suspect_architecture`, `red_herring`,
   `reveal_mechanic`, `social_world`, `alibi`) that a P1-only extraction never produces (P1 only
   has `crime`, `victim`, `closed_world`, `culprit_and_motive`, `resolution`, `investigator`).
   Confirmed directly on `story01_winter_run.json`: exactly the 6 P1 keys, none of the 5 P2 keys
   the registry needs. Every P1-only source — all 12 novels and all 63 anthology stories from
   Session 20 — can only ever be sampled for 3 of the registry's 8 axes.
2. **Even fully-extracted sources waste most of what they capture.** A P1+P2 `ebook_*` source
   has 14 populated fields (confirmed directly), but the registry only ever reads 8 of them —
   `clue_fairness`, `media_and_audience`, `investigator_wound`, `victim`, `resolution`, and
   `investigator` are extracted and then never touched again, for any source, at any depth.

Neither gap was fixed this session (that's a separate, still-open decision — see What is next) —
this audit's real output was scoping the third fix option precisely: wiring the craft-grounding
docs into generation, since raw plot-skeleton extraction was never going to carry dialogue-craft
signal the way `clue_fairness`/`M2`/`M3`-tagged findings can.

### Pitch-deck terminology discussion
Separately, helped name the mechanism driving NPC dialogue/action/asset coherence for a funding
deck — recommended "Continuity Engine" (film/TV production term, maps directly to
`coherence_validator.py` + JSON schema guardrails) with "Arbitration Layer" as a second term
specifically for the Session 21 pooled-question dedup mechanic. No code changes; deck content is
the owner's to finalize.

### Craft-grounding retrieval layer — built and verified
Scoped and built the RAG-wiring mechanism (`CLAUDE.md` to-do item 10), explicitly to "maximum
viable," not minimal — full design discussion in this session's chat log, condensed into
`docs/WIRING.md`'s new "Craft-grounding retrieval (RAG layer)" section (read that section in
full before touching any of this — it's written for a new hire with zero context).

**What got built:**
- **`craft_grounding.py`** (new module) — parses every `*_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md` /
  `RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` doc at the repo root into a structured, retrievable index
  (`GuidanceEntry`: concept, insight, taxonomy tags, game-system tags, confidence tier, source),
  cached to `mystery_database/craft_grounding_index.json` (gitignored — disposable, rebuilt
  automatically whenever a source doc changes). Retrieval (`get_craft_guidance()`) is a pure
  local dict filter — zero added API calls, ever.
- **Confidence-tier respecting**: defaults to excluding `secondary`-tier findings from live
  prompts. Also implemented the doc's own stated distinction — `PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md`'s "Part
  2 — Player Experience" testimonials are reception evidence, not prescriptive technique, per
  that doc's own text — so rows under a "Player Experience"/"Reception" H2 heading are
  automatically capped at secondary confidence and excluded by default.
- **Wired into all four relevant call-sites** in `server/main.py`, each with its own reasoned tag
  set (full rationale table in `docs/WIRING.md`): `_generate_mystery_dict()` (derived per-call
  from whichever part-registry axes this specific mystery sampled), `_generate_witness_scene()`
  (M2/M3/F3 + Interrogation Phase/Social Dynamics), `_investigate_area_with_ai()` (F4/F5 +
  Investigation/Scene Phase), `_follow_lead_with_ai()` (M2/M5/C4 + Investigation/Scene Phase).
  The latter two also picked up their own craft grounding for the first time — previously
  zero-guidance despite firing live, repeatedly, per player, on `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- **Auditable by design, per the owner's explicit ask** — every call that injects guidance
  records exactly which citations it used. Routing differs deliberately by broadcast scope:
  mystery-level guidance rides in `_provenance.craft_guidance` (already stripped from client
  responses by existing code); witness-round guidance is popped off by `_resolve_round()` before
  the WebSocket broadcast and stashed server-side only (round results go to the whole room);
  investigate/lead guidance is safe to return directly in the HTTP response (those are private
  per-player calls, never broadcast).

**Verified, not just written:** parser tested against all 3 real docs (129 entries parsed,
confidence tiers correct after two bugs found and fixed — see below); all four call-sites tested
with a stubbed `llm()` to confirm guidance actually lands in each prompt; `_resolve_round`'s
broadcast-stripping verified directly (guidance present in the raw generator return, absent from
the broadcast payload, present in `round_["_craft_guidance"]`); full `server.main` app import +
route load verified via `TestClient` (31 routes, no wiring errors).

**Two real bugs found and fixed while building, not left in:**
1. Confidence tags like `[full text verified]` can appear in the Concept column, not just
   Insight/Source (McQuarrie's entries do this) — initial version missed them, showing
   `primary` instead of `verified`; fixed by checking all three columns.
2. `PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md`'s Part 2 reception testimonials were initially being retrieved
   identically to Part 1 design-authority findings, surfacing customer-review quotes as
   generation-prompt "craft guidance" — fixed via the H2-heading-based downgrade described above.

### Decision
Craft-guidance wiring stops at "make the existing docs actually influence generation." Neither
of the two extraction-pipeline gaps (registry field-mapping mismatch; re-extracting P1-only
sources at deeper protocol levels) was addressed this session — both remain open, separate
decisions with their own cost tradeoffs.

### What is next
1. Decide on the two extraction-pipeline gaps from this session's audit: fix
   `part_registry.py`'s `KEY_TO_IDX` to also sample the 6 currently-discarded fields (no new API
   cost, unlocks value already paid for across the whole corpus), and/or re-extract the 75
   P1-only sources at `--protocol P1P2` (new API cost, backfills their 5 missing axes
   specifically).
2. True-crime podcast sourcing (still the one open media type per `SOURCING_METHODOLOGY.md`) —
   when written, it becomes retrievable automatically, no `craft_grounding.py` change needed.
3. The "new concepts flagged" taxonomy-formalization decision from `CLAUDE.md` item 10 remains
   open and is explicitly separate from this session's build (see the RAG-review conversation
   this session for why "wiring the mechanism" and "formalizing new taxonomy codes" were kept as
   two different decisions).
4. Everything from Session 21's own "What is next" list is still open (accusation-resolution
   backend, crime-scene/lead-claim redesign, etc.) — untouched this session.

## Session 21 — July 31, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a`
**Starting commit:** `4f2f53c` (tip after Session 20's anthology extraction)
**Latest commit:** `fefe547`
**Status:** Complete — verified prior handoff, closed one corpus gap, then a long design
arc that produced a real multiplayer architecture change, now partly built and verified

> Note: this entry replaces three raw, unedited auto-summaries the Stop hook committed
> during this session ("Session — July 31, 2026 at 18:07/19:00/19:09"). Those had no
> real notes and duplicated commit lists already visible in git log; the actual work
> they point to is captured properly below instead, per the same cleanup Session 19 did.

### Handoff verification
Confirmed the owner's ground truth from session start: the harness had again
auto-assigned a fresh, empty branch (`claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-0sr8pn`,
identical to `main`) instead of continuing the real work — same stale-branch pattern
`CLAUDE.md` already warns about. Switched to the actual active branch. Verified the
anthology extraction the owner ran manually had in fact completed: 63/63 story files
present under `mystery_database/extractions/`, source_id collision fix confirmed
working (hashes the full filename stem, so all 63 stories get distinct source_ids
despite sharing a truncated 30-char filename prefix). One cosmetic-only finding: files
are named `..._antho__story01...` not `..._anthology__...` — intentional `book_slug[:30]`
truncation in `extract_from_pdfs.py`, not a bug.

### New gap found, not closed
`mystery_database/new_sources/` has a 10th file — `The_Devotion_of_Suspect_X_-
_Keigo_Higashino.pdf` — that Session 20's triage never categorized (it covered 9 of
10). Confirmed it is **not** a duplicate of the existing Higashino extraction in the
corpus (that's a different novel, *The Miracles of the Namiya General Store*). Owner
ruled out deleting it. Still needs an actual triage decision — queue it, skip it, or
something else. Tracked as an open task, not resolved this session.

### Corpus composition + sourcing-ratio discussion
Discovered `CLAUDE.md`'s "12 PDF-sourced entries" framing badly undercounts the real
corpus — there are 283 additional `ebook_*` extractions from a prior bulk pipeline run
(bookrix.com sources, P1+P2 depth) sitting in `mystery_database/extractions/` with no
mention in the Current To-Do. Established, with the owner, a short-story-vs-novel
intake ratio for future PDF clearance decisions: favor anthologies heavily (3–5
anthology clearances per 1 novel clearance) while depth stays P1-only for both, since
an anthology yields 15–63x the source_ids per single legal-clearance decision that a
novel does, for currently-identical extraction depth.

### RAG-wiring reprioritization
Discussed whether continual corpus growth costs coherence quality (concluded no — it's
a per-generation sampling function, not corpus-size-dependent; the real risk is
quality dilution from weak sources, not coherence difficulty) and whether short
stories or novels are more valuable given that (concluded: complementary, not
substitutes). This led to reprioritizing `PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md` RAG-wiring ahead of
the previously-planned true-crime podcast sourcing (`CLAUDE.md` to-do item 10's
"START HERE"), since social/party-game craft — the texture of live, competitive,
multiplayer play — has no equivalent in prose extraction at any depth or volume.

Owner pasted full text for the Jackbox "Built In Chicago" article and 3 of 4 targeted
Medway *Behind the Curtain* posts (#1 Total Chaos, #4 Werewolf & Clocktower, #7
Balance — not #2 Outsiders), plus an unlisted bonus strategy-tips post. Reading full
text (not `WebSearch` snippets) surfaced something the snippet-sourced version of the
doc had gotten wrong: *Blood on the Clocktower*'s entire design assumes team-based
cooperative play toward one shared win ("reveal and share, it benefits everyone,"
"what can WE do?") — structurally mismatched with Choose Your Mystery's individually-
competitive, partial-information design (no hidden team, no shared win condition).
Sorted findings into cleanly-transferable (Jackbox's NPC/host UX principles, the
graduated-certainty deduction-logic material, qualitative balance framing) versus
needs-an-explicit-divergence-note (full-transparency advice, the team "ghost vote"
mechanic, team-balance math). **Not yet written into `PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md` itself**
— still open.

### Design-partner discussion (produced tracked decisions, not yet all built)
- Win/solve tension: competitive structure stays as designed, but the sourced material
  says the *texture* of losing (interrogation banter, near-misses) is what's actually
  remembered, not the win/loss outcome — and CYM is deliberately lower-stakes/quicker-
  to-restart than the live-hosted-party or *Clocktower* reference material, which
  tempers how much "soften the loss" design effort is actually warranted.
- Invisible per-player catch-up assistance — captured as future scope, tied to a
  precedent in the owner's other project (MYF) and to a Medway concept already flagged
  in `PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md` ("Storyteller subtly rebalancing mid-session").
- "What I know vs. what's shared" knowledge-comparison screen — captured, ties directly
  to the sourced "knowledge asymmetry is the addictive core" finding.
- End-game resolution/summation scene — captured, reuses the two-output-per-call
  pattern (cheap player-facing text + hidden video-prompt content) established below.

### Paradigm shift: lockstep multiplayer redesign
Walked a concrete "Murder on Mars" use case against the **actual** running code
(not `CLAUDE.md`'s aspirational description) and found real, previously-undocumented
gaps: the documented "75%-random-share" mechanic doesn't exist in code at all (the
real mechanic is a player-choice minimum-share threshold, 50/60/70% by difficulty,
broadcast to everyone who shares); interrogation questions are free text, not a
pick-list; phases are sequential-mandatory, not player-choice; the multiplayer witness
prompt was missing the evasion/anti-spoiler instruction the old solo endpoint has; and
there is **no backend endpoint anywhere for resolving a multiplayer accusation** — the
only accusation code (`accusation.gd`) is single-player-era, checks the guess locally
against the solution already sitting in the client's own copy of the mystery JSON.

This led to a full redesign, worked through collaboratively: lockstep round
synchronization (everyone submits before anyone advances, replacing the old
per-player-async phase model) instead of N isolated interrogation calls per witness;
one shared dramatized scene per round instead of per-question isolation; claim-based
lead reservation tied directly to solvability (a duplicated lead pick could leave the
one culprit-pointing lead unexplored by anyone); and the same "cheap text now, hidden
video-prompt-ready content for later" two-output pattern established for the opening
scene, reused conceptually for the planned resolution scene.

### What got built and shipped this session
1. **Opening scene split** (`_generate_cinematic_brief`): now returns
   `opening_narration` (player-facing prose, cheap) and `cinematic_brief` (hidden,
   camera-direction language, ready for future video generation) from one call
   instead of one video-only output. `docs/WIRING.md` updated. — commit `acf64cc`
2. **Lockstep round state machine**: game-level `stage`/`round` fields, additive
   alongside the legacy per-player `phase` (nothing existing broken). Four endpoints
   (`round/open`, `round/submit`, `round/status`, `round/resolve`), four new
   WebSocket events, lazy timeout handling so one AFK player can't stall a round
   forever. Verified via direct function tests (happy path + timeout path) and a full
   FastAPI `TestClient` HTTP flow. `docs/WIRING.md` updated this session. — commit
   `899fa8d`
3. **Witness interrogation redesign**: players submit up to
   `questions_per_round` (3/2/1 by difficulty) questions per round, hybrid
   pick-list-or-free-text; one generation call pools and dedupes everyone's
   questions, returns a scene bounded to 2–3 sentences regardless of pool size plus a
   private answer per question; no random cross-player answer distribution (a
   deliberate simplification over the original "70% randomized" pitch, chosen for
   legibility). Same mechanism covers the secondary witness via a second round with a
   different `character_name`. Verified via stubbed-LLM tests (dedup correctness,
   prompt content, answer redistribution) and full HTTP-level `TestClient` flow
   including the validation-rejection path. Old `/interrogate-witness` and witness
   `/share-phase` endpoints deliberately left untouched — owner's explicit call, since
   `mobile.html` still targets them and no replacement UI exists yet. — commit
   `fefe547`

### What is next
See `CLAUDE.md` → Current To-Do for the full tracked backlog. In dependency order:
1. Accusation-resolution backend (independent of the rest, and blocks the resolution
   scene below) — no multiplayer-safe way to declare a winner exists yet.
2. Crime-scene investigation redesign and the knowledge-comparison screen (both
   depend on the lockstep mechanism, now in place).
3. Lead-claim reservation + scaling lead count to max players (8, per the Phase 3e
   avatar decision already on record).
4. End-game resolution/summation scene — blocked on the accusation backend.
5. Separate thread, not part of this redesign: finish verifying + writing the sorted
   `PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md` findings, then wire it into the generation and
   `/interrogate` prompts; decide the still-open Devotion of Suspect X triage.

## Session 20 — July 29, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a`
**Starting commit:** `82cd423`
**Status:** Complete — anthology ingestion support added and verified against a real 822-page
short-story collection; batch of other new-source files reviewed but not yet processed

### What was done
The owner pushed several files into `mystery_database/new_sources/`, intending to send one short-
story anthology PDF but sweeping in a whole local staging folder. Triaged all 10:

- 4 already match existing extraction slugs exactly (Circular Staircase, Greene Murder Case,
  Leavenworth Case, Red House Mystery) — harmless no-ops, `extract_from_pdfs.py`'s dedup check
  skips them automatically.
- 3 are full novels (Benjamin Stevenson ×2, Tana French's *Faithful Place*) — legitimate future
  corpus additions, queued for later one-at-a-time ingestion per usual.
- 1 (`In the Fog, by Richard Harding Davis.html`) is an `.html` file — `extract_from_pdfs.py` only
  reads PDFs via `pypdf`; unsupported as-is regardless of the short-story question.
- 1 (`The_Best_of_Mystery_1980_Anthology_-_Alfred_Hitchcock.pdf`, 822 pages, 63 stories) is the
  anthology the owner actually meant to send — and confirmed the motivating case for this
  session's work: `extract_from_pdfs.py` assumed one PDF = one continuous novel-length narrative
  (begin/middle/end sampling capped at `MAX_TEXT_CHARS=6000`), which would either splice together
  fragments of unrelated stories or silently discard most of a multi-story file.

Added `--anthology` mode to `scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py`:
- Detects per-story boundaries via a formatting pattern common to this kind of anthology — an
  ALL-CAPS byline immediately followed by a title line, at the very top of each story's first
  page — rather than trying to align a Contents-page listing against body text (title punctuation
  routinely differs between the two, confirmed on this file: TOC "YOU CANT BLAME ME" vs. body
  "You Can't Blame Me").
- Skips all front matter by scanning only after the last "CONTENTS" heading, avoiding false
  positives on the title page (which has the same "ALL-CAPS name over a title-cased line" shape).
- Uses each story's **full text** for extraction rather than begin/middle/end sampling — sampling
  exists to cheaply approximate a full novel (a ~1% sample of a 300K+ char, mostly-redundant text);
  applied to a ~25K-char short story it would cut ~75% of a text with no slack, in three
  disconnected chunks. Cost check: full-text vs. sliced across all 63 stories on Haiku 4.5 differs
  by about $0.30 total (~$0.10 sliced vs. ~$0.41 full-text for P1 input tokens) — negligible next
  to the quality/coherence risk sampling introduces on short-form prose. A per-story fallback to
  begin/middle/end sampling still applies past `ANTHOLOGY_FULLTEXT_THRESHOLD` (25,000 chars) to
  bound the rare outlier-length story.
- Emits one output JSON per story with its own `source_id`, `--dry-run` support to review the
  detected split before spending any API calls, and a Contents-count cross-check as a sanity
  warning (not a hard gate).

**Verified against the real file** (dry-run, no API calls): detected all **63 of 63** stories
correctly on the first real pass but one — `#8` (a Jack Ritchie story whose title has zero
alphabetic characters) was initially skipped by an overly strict title-line heuristic; fixed and
re-verified 63/63 exact.

**Also fixed a real, already-live bug found while building this**: `part_registry.py`'s
`_atomize_extraction()` derived each source's `source_id` from `f.stem[:8]` (first 8 characters of
the filename). The four `pdf_the_*` extractions already in the corpus all collapse to the same
`source_id` (`corpus_pdf_the_`) today, silently defeating `sample_for_generation`'s
`max_per_source` diversity constraint — confirmed via direct inspection, not yet visible in
`part_registry.json` only because that file hasn't been regenerated since those sources were
added. Multiple stories from one anthology sharing a filename prefix would have made this far
worse (all 63 collapsing to one source). Fixed by hashing the full filename stem instead of
truncating it.

### Decision
Anthology support lives as a separate `--anthology` mode rather than auto-detected — the existing
single-novel path (and its cost-driven sampling) stays untouched for the three queued novels.

### What is next
1. Actually run `--anthology` against `The_Best_of_Mystery_1980_Anthology_-_Alfred_Hitchcock.pdf`
   for real (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, not set in this session) — the dry-run split is verified,
   nothing has been extracted yet.
2. Ingest the three queued novels one at a time, per the usual process.
3. `.html` source support is a real gap if the owner wants to ingest non-PDF sources later (the
   Richard Harding Davis novella) — not built, not requested yet.
4. Once the registry is next rebuilt from `mystery_database/extractions/`, verify the `source_id`
   fix actually resolves the diversity-constraint bug in practice (checked functionally in this
   session via a throwaway in-memory `PartRegistry`, not by regenerating the committed
   `part_registry.json`).

## Session 19 — July 29, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a`
**Starting commit:** `60cf31c` (tip after Session 18 merged)
**Status:** Complete — two new craft-grounding companion docs; session interrupted mid-flow by
a client-side hangup, resumed and closed out properly here (see also `SOURCING_METHODOLOGY.md`,
added this session)

> Note: this entry replaces three raw, unedited auto-summaries the `Stop` hook committed during
> the interruption (`d5fdb2b`, `987c49a`'s summary, and one more — commits `3647bd8`, `7839022`,
> and the summary that would have followed `987c49a`). Those auto-summaries had no notes and
> cluttered the log with duplicate commit dumps; the real work they point to is captured properly
> below instead. Nothing was reverted — only the log entries describing it were consolidated.

### What was done
Kicked off **CLAUDE.md Current To-Do item 10** (RAG for mystery best-practices): extended the
writer-grounded taxonomy in `RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` to two new media types, as companion docs:

- **`SCREEN_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md`** — mystery film/TV directors and screenwriters: Rian Johnson,
  Steven Moffat, John Hoffman, Chris Chibnall, Nic Pizzolatto, Anthony Horowitz, Alfred Hitchcock,
  Christopher McQuarrie. Maps findings onto existing P1–P4 taxonomy codes where they fit, and
  explicitly flags genuinely new concepts (e.g. "howcatchem" as a second structural mode,
  production-security-as-craft-practice) for future taxonomy discussion rather than silently
  editing the codes.
- **`PARTY_CRAFT_FINDINGS.md`** — live/social-deduction game craft: Jackbox Games, Murder Mystery
  Co, Steven Medway (*Blood on the Clocktower*), plus a Part 2 of player-experience/testimonial
  evidence kept in a visibly separate citation register from Part 1's design authority. This is
  arguably the most directly relevant companion doc, since it grounds *mechanics* (the 75%
  sharing mechanic, interrogation phase, competitive accusation endgame) rather than prose/screen
  plot construction.

Both docs independently arrived at the same sourcing discipline: confidence-tiered citations
(`[full text verified]` vs. WebSearch-snippet-attributed vs. `[third-party analysis]`), and a
rule that a candidate new-taxonomy concept only gets flagged as higher-confidence once 2+
independent creators name it. This session extracted that discipline into a standalone
**`SOURCING_METHODOLOGY.md`** so it's explicit and reusable for the next media type, rather than
re-derived per document.

**Known constraint discovered:** direct `WebFetch` to most interview/article hosts is blocked by
this session's egress policy (403 on CONNECT, confirmed via `$HTTPS_PROXY/__agentproxy/status`
as a policy denial, not a site-side block). `WebSearch` still returns attributed excerpts, so
that's the default research path; user-pasted full text (used for the Hitchcock and McQuarrie
sections) is the way to reach `[full text verified]` confidence when needed.

### Decision
Neither companion doc is wired into the actual generation prompt (`server/main.py`) yet, and
shouldn't be until quotes are verified against full source text — both docs say so explicitly.
This session's scope was documentation only: consolidate the log, update the to-do, codify the
sourcing process. Wiring retrieval into generation is separate follow-on work, tracked as its own
to-do item now that the source material exists.

### What is next
1. **True-crime podcast producers/hosts** — the one media type discussed but not yet captured;
   per `SOURCING_METHODOLOGY.md`, scope strictly to hosts' own craft-reflection commentary
   ("what makes this case compelling"), never the underlying case narrative itself.
2. **Verification pass** — confirm WebSearch-snippet-sourced quotes in both new docs against full
   source text before any of this feeds a generation prompt.
3. **Build the actual RAG wiring** — once verified, extend `server/main.py`'s
   `_generate_mystery_dict()` to retrieve and inject relevant craft guidance from all three
   companion docs, keyed off the sampled parts/setting. Not started.
4. **Taxonomy discussion** — each companion doc's "New concepts flagged" sections have accumulated
   real candidates (e.g. howcatchem mode, production-security practices, secondary per-player
   objectives) that need a human decision on whether to formally add to `extraction_protocols.py`.

## Session 18 — July 22, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a`
**Starting commit:** `b2cdcc3` (tip of `main`, after PR #4 and PR #5 merged)
**Status:** Complete — repo-wide branch audit; PR #4 reviewed and merged

### What was done
- Reviewed **PR #4** ("Lock Phase 3e design: two-layer avatar model + player profile schema"):
  docs-only, sound content, but flagged two issues before merge — a duplicate "Session 16" label
  colliding with this session's own log entry, and a wrong branch name in that entry. Owner
  merged it and resolved the conflict directly (renumbered to Session 17, fixed the branch name,
  added a note explaining the collision) — see that entry above.
- Ran a full audit of every branch on `origin` beyond `main` (31 total). Findings:
  - **9 branches are fully absorbed into `main` already** (zero unique commits) — safe to delete
    with no risk of losing work: `claude/blissful-wozniak-Z0wIU`, `claude/mystery-pdf-extraction-0fisq0`,
    `claude/post-merge-docs-sync`, `claude/review-and-resume-1k0tP`,
    `claude/review-changes-mmmec1tknjh846kb-08C3q`, `claude/strike-stale-branch-note`,
    `claude/phase-3e-avatar-design` (now merged as PR #4), `dev/choose-your-mystery`,
    `dev/cryptic-challenge`. Owner to delete via GitHub UI — `git push --delete` is blocked by the
    same 403 policy that blocks direct pushes to `main`, and no branch-delete tool is exposed via
    the GitHub MCP server either.
  - **`dev/mind-your-friends` is NOT stale** — pushed 2026-07-22 (same day), 43 commits, and its
    diff vs `main` actively reverses the Godot/FastAPI reconciliation (deletes `server/main.py`,
    `server/Dockerfile`, the mobile client; un-deprecates old Streamlit files). Owner confirmed
    this is a **real, separate second project** ("MYF") intentionally sharing this repo. **Do not
    touch, delete, or merge anything on this branch** — it is out of scope for Choose Your Mystery
    cleanup work entirely.
  - **21 branches have real unique commits (1–39 each) but no open PR**, dating from Feb–July
    2026 — never reviewed, never merged, never cleaned up. Owner has made their own list of which
    of these (excluding `dev/*`) to delete and will handle it on their own schedule outside this
    session. No action taken on these here.

### Decision
`dev/mind-your-friends` is confirmed off-limits for any Choose Your Mystery repo cleanup —
treat it as a separate project's branch that happens to live in the same repo. Do not include it
in future branch-hygiene passes.

### What is next
- Owner will delete the 9 confirmed-safe branches plus their own selection from the 21 stale ones,
  at their own pace — no follow-up needed from a session unless asked.
- Next thread of work (starting immediately after this log entry): RAG (retrieval-augmented
  generation) for mystery best-practices — not yet scoped; see next session entry.

---

## Session 16 — July 22, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/session-wrapup-cleanup-blocker-3val9a`
**Starting commit:** `57575c1` (tip of `main`)
**Status:** Complete — no code changes; resolved a stale-request false alarm

### The problem
The owner pasted a leftover exchange from before Session 15's PR #1 merged, asking Claude Code
to "merge PR#1" into `main`. This looked like a live blocker but wasn't one.

### What was found
- PR #1 (`claude/mystery-pdf-extraction-0fisq0` → `main`) was already merged on 2026-07-14
  18:05 UTC (merge commit `faf52e0`, confirmed via GitHub). `main` and this session's branch are
  identical — no diff, clean working tree.
- Separately, the owner had tried running `scripts/session_summary.py` (the interactive,
  non-`--auto` mode used to type free-form session notes) directly instead of letting the
  `Stop` hook run it in `--auto --quiet` mode. That mode calls Python's `input()` in a loop —
  Claude Code's Bash tool has no live interactive stdin, so the process just blocks forever
  with no way to type a response. That's the actual "Claude Code cannot move forward" symptom.

### Decision
No merge action needed — PR #1 was stale news. Session closed with no code changes; this entry
exists so a future session doesn't re-open the same already-resolved question. If free-form
notes need to be added to `SESSIONS.md` interactively again, don't run
`scripts/session_summary.py` without `--auto` from Claude Code — dictate the notes to Claude Code
directly and have it edit this file instead.

---

## Session 17 — July 14, 2026 (design-only, no code)
**Branch:** `claude/phase-3e-avatar-design`
**Status:** Complete — Phase 3e avatar + player-profile design locked

> Numbering note: this session ran on July 14, concurrently with what became Session 16 above
> (both independently claimed "Session 16" since neither branch could see the other's log entry
> until this PR merged). Renumbered to 17 on merge to avoid a duplicate; no content changed.

### What was decided
Talked through Phase 3e (avatar pool + player history, designed-not-built since Session 14) end
to end and landed on a two-layer avatar model instead of either of the two originally-posed
options (persistent per-player identity vs. disposable per-mystery pool):

- **Base look** — era-appropriate portrait, shared/cached per `<era_key>`, same pattern as the
  existing localization cache. Solves the original concern (a jazz-age portrait showing up in an
  Ancient Rome mystery) since it was never actually possible under the era-keyed pool design —
  the real gap was that pools had no persistent-identity axis at all.
- **Signature accessory** — a small fixed prop (monocle, scarf, etc.) chosen once at registration
  and kept forever, deliberately anachronistic across eras. This is the persistence layer: cheap
  because it's drawn from a small fixed catalog (era × accessory stays a bounded, cacheable
  space), not freeform per-player generation.
- Combining the two is a prompt modifier on the existing pool mechanism, not a new pipeline —
  cached lazily under `<era_key>/<base_look_id>__<accessory_id>.png`.

Full spec — lobby-join flow, player-profile JSON schema, proposed 16-item accessory catalog,
cold-start fallback, and the five open questions each resolved to a default (registration
skippable; accessory permanent; pool sized for 8-player lobbies; static placeholder on cold
start; `localStorage` token now with `steam_id` reserved for Phase 4) — written up in
`docs/WIRING.md` under "Avatar system + player profiles (Phase 3e)".

Also fixed: `docs/WIRING.md`'s "Active branches" footer still named two branches from before the
July 9 reconciliation (`claude/setup-api-and-mysteries-LRLQK`, `claude/mystery-versioning-system-TPblK`).
Removed the duplicate tracking — `CLAUDE.md` is the single source of truth for branch status now.

### What is next
1. **Build Phase 3e** per the locked spec in `docs/WIRING.md` — nothing below exists yet:
   - `mystery_database/accessory_catalog.json`
   - Avatar pool generation script (fal.ai FLUX client, lazy-cache-on-request)
   - `server/main.py`: player registration/upsert, avatar fetch-or-generate, `mysteries_played` logging
   - Godot: registration screen, 3-candidate portrait picker in `Lobby.tscn`
   - Cold-start placeholder asset
2. Sign off on (or edit) the proposed 16-item accessory catalog before it's built
3. `docs/WIRING.md` still has broader staleness beyond the two things fixed this session — several
   sections reference `app.py`/`cli.py` as if still live (e.g. "Localization pass", "Where the
   cinematic brief is triggered", the `cli.py extract` commands under "Extraction protocols").
   Worth a dedicated pass, not done here since it wasn't this session's ask.

---

## Session 15 — July 9, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/mystery-pdf-extraction-0fisq0`
**Starting commit:** `84424e2` (tip of `claude/review-and-resume-1k0tP`)
**Status:** Complete — branch reconciliation + Streamlit deprecation cleanup

### The problem
Several past sessions had been auto-assigned fresh branches off older commits instead of
continuing the actual active branch. This left multiple divergent "current states" of the repo
existing in parallel with no single source of truth:
- `claude/review-and-resume-1k0tP` — the real Godot tip (Phase 3d, includes Session 14's
  `deprecated/` cleanup)
- `claude/fix-godot-performance-QyXLQ` and `claude/start-godot-migration-mNrWD` — earlier,
  now-superseded points in the same Godot lineage
- `claude/review-godot-migration-GiLDz` — a *stranded* branch (misleadingly named, contains no
  Godot code) that forked from the same pre-migration point and did one day of PDF-ingestion
  work (`scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py`, 8 new corpus extractions from Gilbert/Akunin/Higashino
  PDFs, a cast-of-characters text-sampling bug fix) that never got folded into the Godot line
- `claude/mystery-pdf-extraction-0fisq0` (this session's assigned branch) — itself just an empty
  fork of the old pre-migration point, with none of the above
- `CLAUDE.md` on `main` was stale, pointing at a fifth branch (`claude/setup-api-and-mysteries-LRLQK`)
  that predates the Godot pivot entirely

Root cause: no session was reliably merging its branch back before the next one started fresh.

### What was done
- Rebuilt this branch from `claude/review-and-resume-1k0tP` (the true Godot tip)
- Cherry-picked the stranded PDF-ingestion work from `claude/review-godot-migration-GiLDz`:
  `scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py` and the 8 extraction JSONs it produced
- Restored `extraction_protocols.py` from `deprecated/` to root — Session 14's deprecation sweep
  predated the PDF-ingestion work and didn't know it was still a live dependency
  (`scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py` imports it; `part_registry.load_registry()` reads every JSON
  in `mystery_database/extractions/` live, so the new PDF-derived corpus entries are active data)
- Rewrote `CLAUDE.md`: corrected Active Branch, added the corpus-expansion workflow
  (`scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py`, run with `python3` — this environment has no `python` alias)
  to Key Files and the caching-rules table, documented which branches are now safe to delete
- Rewrote `README.md` — it still had the original HuggingFace Streamlit metadata block and
  "`streamlit run app.py`" instructions at the top, missed by Session 14's cleanup. Now describes
  the Godot + FastAPI setup, with an explicit note that the Streamlit version is retired and
  archived under `deprecated/`.

### Decision (owner, this session)
**Godot is the confirmed, sole direction going forward.** All Streamlit/HuggingFace-era code
stays archived in `deprecated/` for provenance — not deleted, not resurrected.

### Follow-up within this session
- Opened **PR #1** (`claude/mystery-pdf-extraction-0fisq0` → `main`):
  https://github.com/Blutomania/SocialGaming/pull/1 — open, `mergeable_state: clean`, not yet merged
- Owner is deleting the five superseded branches manually via GitHub UI (git push --delete was
  blocked with the same 403 policy that blocks direct pushes to `main`; no delete-ref tool was
  available either) — **owner action, in progress, not yet confirmed done**
- Owner hit a real bug running `scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py` locally: `extract_pdf()` returned
  bare `None` (instead of the `(None, "")` tuple its signature promises) when the Claude API call
  raised — e.g. on an invalid key — so `main()`'s unconditional tuple-unpack crashed the whole
  batch with `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object` instead of recording one
  clean failure and continuing. Fixed in commit `8967754` (single-line fix, `return None` →
  `return None, ""`), pushed to this branch/PR.
- Root cause of the original 401 was a stale/missing local `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — owner fixed by
  exporting a fresh key via `~/.zshrc`.
- Owner then successfully ran full ingestion end-to-end locally:
  `python3 scripts/extract_from_pdfs.py mystery_database/new_sources/ --protocol P1` —
  **4/4 processed, 0 failed** — and pushed the results directly to this branch (commit `00bca46`):
  - `pdf_the_circular_staircase_project_gutenberg.json` (Mary Roberts Rinehart)
  - `pdf_the_greene_murder_case_project_gutenberg.json` (S.S. Van Dine)
  - `pdf_the_leavenworth_case_a_lawyer_s_story_by_anna_katharine_gree.json` (Anna Katharine Green)
  - `pdf_the_red_house_mystery_by_a_a_milne.json` (A.A. Milne)
  - Also updated `pdf_smallbone_deceased_a_london_mystery_brit_michael_gilbert.json` — a
    `--fill-resolution` pass filled a previously-null resolution (confidence low → high)
  - Spot-checked `pdf_the_red_house_mystery_by_a_a_milne.json`: `crime` field quotes real
    Chapter III narration, not a table-of-contents artifact — extraction quality looks sound
- Corpus now has 12 PDF-sourced entries total (8 from the prior stranded-branch session + 4 new)

### What is next
1. **Confirm PR #1 merged into `main`** — was open and clean as of session end, not yet merged
2. **Confirm the five superseded branches were actually deleted** (owner was doing this manually
   when this session ended — verify, don't re-assume)
3. Resume Phase 3d work from Session 14 (avatar pool system, player history tracking — see
   Session 14 below)
4. Consider whether the corpus JSONs added this session should also get folded into
   `part_registry.json` itself, or whether relying on `load_extractions()`'s live directory scan
   at runtime is sufficient going forward (currently sufficient — no action required unless
   startup load time becomes a concern)

## Session 14 — April 20, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/review-and-resume-1k0tP`
**Starting commit:** `403ba24`
**Status:** Complete — Phase 3d lobby flow built

### What was done

**Housekeeping:**
- Reset branch to Phase 3c-complete state (`claude/fix-godot-performance-QyXLQ`)
- Moved all pre-Godot Python tooling to `deprecated/` (app.py, cli.py, corpus pipeline, etc.)
- Updated CLAUDE.md: correct active branch, Phase 3c marked done, Phase 3d as next

**Phase 3d — Lobby flow:**

**`server/main.py`:**
- Added `StartGameRequest` Pydantic model
- `GET /games/{game_id}/lobby` — returns player list, mystery title, difficulty
- `POST /games/{game_id}/start` — host-only; broadcasts `game_started` WebSocket event

**`godot/scripts/autoloads/GameState.gd`:**
- Added `is_multiplayer: bool` flag (set by MainMenu, cleared on reset)

**`godot/scripts/autoloads/ApiClient.gd`:**
- Added `get_lobby()` and `start_game()` methods

**`godot/scenes/ui/MainMenu.tscn` + `main_menu.gd`:**
- Renamed "New Game" → "New Game (Solo)"
- Added "Multiplayer" button; sets `GameState.is_multiplayer = true` before routing to MysteryGeneration

**`godot/scenes/ui/MysteryGeneration.tscn` + `mystery_generation.gd`:**
- Added `MultiplayerSection` (hidden in solo): host name input + difficulty OptionButton
- After generation: if multiplayer → `create_game()` → `Lobby.tscn`; if solo → `CaseDisplay.tscn` (unchanged)

**`godot/scenes/ui/Lobby.tscn` + `godot/scripts/ui/lobby.gd`** — NEW:
- Displays room code and join URL (`SERVER_URL/play`)
- Live player list fed by `player_joined` WebSocket events
- "Start Game" button → `POST /start` → `game_started` broadcast → transitions to `CaseDisplay.tscn`
- "Cancel" returns to MainMenu and resets state

**`server/static/mobile.html`:**
- Added lobby waiting screen (shown after join, before host starts)
- localStorage persists player name across visits (zero friction on return)
- `game_started` WebSocket event triggers transition from lobby → investigation
- `player_joined` event adds player to lobby list

### Design decisions

**Player identity (decided):** `localStorage` token approach deferred to Phase 3e (avatar system).
For now, name is persisted in `localStorage` for convenience; no cross-device identity.

**Avatar system (designed, not built):**
- Setting-matched AI portraits (3 per player, era-styled, generated during lobby wait)
- Era-keyed pool in `mystery_database/avatar_pool/<era_key>/` — same key as localization cache
- Pre-generated pool + background replenishment; players' seen IDs tracked in localStorage
- Image API: FLUX via fal.ai recommended (~$0.003/image)
- Scheduled for Phase 3e, after lobby is confirmed working

### What is next

1. **[NEXT — Phase 3e]** Avatar pool system: seed pools per era, serve 3 portraits at lobby join, player picks one
2. **[NEXT — Phase 3e]** Player history tracking: localStorage token as persistent ID, `mystery_database/player_history/` JSON files, deduplication at generation time
3. **[FUTURE — Phase 3d test]** End-to-end playtest: host Godot + 1+ phones through full lobby → investigation → accusation
4. **[FUTURE]** Phase 4 — Steam integration (GodotSteam plugin)

## Session 12 — April 4, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/fix-godot-performance-QyXLQ`
**Starting commit:** `4235c7c`
**Ending commit:** `a7a361c`
**Status:** Complete — Phase 3a/3b implemented; architecture decided

### What was designed (no code yet)

**Sharing mechanic (revised):**
- Old: fixed % of *players* receive all your findings
- New: you select 50–70% of your findings; **all** players receive what you chose
- Individual deduction is the skill — everyone works from the same shared pool
- Minimum share % is difficulty-gated: EASY 70%, MEDIUM 60%, HARD 50%
- Duplicate check on submission: if a clue is already in the pool, you must replace it

**Three-phase investigation structure:**
```
Witness Phase (X questions) → Investigation Phase (Y areas) → Lead Phase (2 leads) → Accusation
```
Each phase has a hard budget. When budget hits 0 → Share Selection screen → advance to next phase.

**Multiplayer architecture (confirmed):**
- **Godot desktop** = host/TV screen, atmospheric, Steamworks-connected (keep Godot)
- **HTML phone client** = thin browser page served by FastAPI, no download required
- **Pattern**: Jackbox model — host runs Godot, players open a URL on their phones
- **Transport**: FastAPI WebSocket (upgrade from current HTTP polling)
- **Room codes**: short alphanumeric (e.g. "A7FX2"), phone players type it in at the URL

**Why Godot over all-Python:**
- GodotSteam is the best Steamworks integration for indie; Python bindings are DIY
- Godot Linux export = Steam Deck first-class support for free
- Host screen can be cinematic and atmospheric; phones are deliberately minimal
- ENet (Godot's UDP networking) doesn't work in browsers — use WebSocket instead

### What was built (committed)

**`server/main.py`:**
- Mystery generation prompt updated: now requests `investigation_areas` (5) and `leads` (4)
- In-memory game session store (`_games` dict, same pattern as async job store)
- 8 new endpoints:
  - `POST /games/create` — create session from mystery slug + difficulty
  - `POST /games/{id}/join` — register player, get player_id + budgets
  - `POST /games/{id}/interrogate-witness` — budget-checked, hard-blocked, Claude AI call
  - `POST /games/{id}/investigate-area` — budget-checked, hard-blocked, Claude AI call
  - `POST /games/{id}/follow-lead` — max 2 per player, hard-blocked, Claude AI call
  - `POST /games/{id}/share-phase` — validates min %, checks dupes, broadcasts to all
  - `GET /games/{id}/block-pool` — current blocked questions/areas/leads
  - `GET /games/{id}/shared-clues` — all shared clues for polling

**Godot:**
- `MysteryData.gd` — added `InvestigationAreaData` and `LeadData` inner classes
- `GameState.gd` — full rewrite: `InvestPhase` enum, per-phase budgets, block pool, shared clues dict, helper methods (`is_witness_blocked`, `is_area_blocked`, `is_lead_blocked`, `current_phase_findings`, `reset`)
- `ApiClient.gd` — 8 new game API methods; single-player `/interrogate` preserved
- `interrogation.gd` — full rewrite: phase-aware Witness/Investigation/Lead sub-panels, block-pool polling, shared intel panel
- `share_selection.gd` — new: Share Selection screen with minimum enforcement, duplicate conflict highlighting
- `ShareSelection.tscn` — new: scene for share_selection.gd
- `case_display.gd` — added investigation areas, leads, Shared Intel panel with polling

### What still needs to be done

1. **`invest_phase` transition bug**: `_check_phase_complete()` in `interrogation.gd` transitions directly to `ShareSelection.tscn` but doesn't first set `invest_phase` to `SHARE_WITNESS`. Needs: set phase to `SHARE_WITNESS` before `change_scene_to_file`.
2. **`.tscn` wiring**: `Interrogation.tscn` needs new sub-panel nodes (WitnessPanel, InvestigationPanel, LeadPanel, SharedPanel). `CaseDisplay.tscn` needs AreasContainer, LeadsContainer, SharedIntelContainer nodes.
3. **WebSocket upgrade**: Replace HTTP polling with FastAPI WebSocket push. Server broadcasts `clues_shared` + `block_updated` events instead of clients polling.
4. **`mobile.html`** — phone client: simple HTML/JS page served by FastAPI, connects via WebSocket, handles all three phases + share selection.
5. **QR code or room URL display** on Godot host screen so players can join easily.

### Next steps (resume here)
1. Fix the `invest_phase` transition bug (1-line fix in `interrogation.gd`)
2. Wire the `.tscn` node trees to match `@onready` paths in scripts
3. Add `WebSocket /ws/{game_id}` endpoint to FastAPI + `ConnectionManager` class
4. Upgrade Godot `ApiClient.gd` to use `WebSocketPeer` instead of polling
5. Build `mobile.html` — phone client served at `/play`
6. End-to-end playtest: 2 players (desktop + phone) through all 3 phases + accusation

---

## Session 13 — April 4, 2026 (continuation)
**Branch:** `claude/fix-godot-performance-QyXLQ`
**Starting commit:** `389c154`
**Status:** In progress — Phase 3c

### What was built so far this session

**Bug fix — `interrogation.gd`:**
- `_check_phase_complete()` now sets `GameState.invest_phase` to the correct `SHARE_*`
  enum value before transitioning to `ShareSelection.tscn`. Without this, the share
  screen had no idea which findings to display.

**`.tscn` wiring:**
- `Interrogation.tscn` — full rewrite to match all `@onready` paths in `interrogation.gd`:
  `PhaseLabel`, `BudgetLabel`, `WitnessPanel` (with `SuspectDropdown`, `QuestionInput`,
  `AskButton`, scroll history), `InvestigationPanel` (with `AreasContainer`),
  `LeadPanel` (with `LeadsContainer`), `SharedPanel` (with `SharedContainer`),
  `StatusLabel`, `Spinner`, `AccuseButton`, `BackButton`.
- `CaseDisplay.tscn` — added `AreasContainer`, `LeadsContainer`, `SharedIntelContainer`
  nodes under `ScrollContainer/MainVBox`.
- `case_display.gd` — fixed `@onready` paths from `$MainVBox/...` to
  `$ScrollContainer/MainVBox/...` (the node is not a direct child of the root).

**FastAPI WebSocket (`server/main.py`):**
- Added `import asyncio` and `WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect` to FastAPI imports.
- Added `fastapi.responses.HTMLResponse` and `fastapi.staticfiles.StaticFiles`.
- `ConnectionManager` class: async `connect`, `disconnect`, `broadcast` with per-room
  dict; `_broadcast_sync()` helper bridges sync endpoints to async WS sends.
- `GET /ws/{game_id}` WebSocket endpoint: accepts connection, broadcasts `player_joined`,
  listens for pings, cleans up on disconnect.
- `GET /play` — serves `server/static/mobile.html`.
- `app.mount("/static", ...)` — StaticFiles middleware for phone client assets.
- `share_phase` endpoint now calls `_broadcast_sync` for `clues_shared`,
  `block_updated`, and `player_phase_done` events on successful share.
- `join_game` endpoint now broadcasts `player_joined` to the room.

**Godot WebSocket upgrade:**
- `ApiClient.gd` — added `signal ws_event(event_name, data)`, `WebSocketPeer _ws`,
  `connect_ws(game_id, player_id)`, `disconnect_ws()`. `_process()` polls the peer and
  emits `ws_event` on each incoming JSON message.
- `interrogation.gd` — removed poll timer + `_poll_server()`. On `_ready()`, connects
  `ApiClient.ws_event` to `_on_ws_event()` (handles `block_updated`, `clues_shared`,
  `player_joined`). Disconnects signal in `_exit_tree()`.
- `case_display.gd` — same: removed poll timer, connects `ws_event` to `_on_ws_event`
  which calls `merge_shared_clues` + `_rebuild_shared_intel` on `clues_shared`.

### Still to do this session
- `server/static/mobile.html` — phone client (in progress)
- Commit and push
- End-to-end test: 2 players through all 3 phases + accusation

### If session ends before mobile.html is done
Resume by: write `server/static/mobile.html`.
It needs to: join by room code + name → WebSocket connect → three phase UIs
(witness: dropdown + text input; investigation: area buttons; lead: lead buttons) →
share selection checkboxes → shared intel feed. All via WebSocket + HTTP fetch calls
to the existing FastAPI endpoints.

## Session 11 — April 2, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/start-godot-migration-mNrWD`
**Starting commit:** `380f0e2`
**Status:** Complete — Godot project loads without errors

### What was done
- Fixed `ApiClient.gd` parse error: GDScript can't handle multi-line lambdas capturing
  outer-scope variables. Rewrote using `.bind(req, callback)` on a named `_on_done()`
  method instead. Simpler and more reliable.
- Fixed `project.godot` version: updated `4.2` → `4.6` to match installed Godot version.
- Godot 4.6 confirmed: project opens and all autoloads load without errors.

### Known: project.godot drift
Godot rewrites `project.godot` on every open. Before pushing, run:
`git checkout -- godot/project.godot` to discard Godot's local changes, then pull.
Long-term fix: commit Godot's version after each session.

### Next steps (resume here — Phase 2)
1. Start backend: `cd SocialGaming && ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... uvicorn server.main:app --port 8000`
2. Press F5 in Godot — MainMenu should load and status label should go green
3. Click "New Game", type a prompt, click "Generate Mystery"
4. Verify CaseDisplay loads with mystery title, suspects, evidence
5. Interrogate a suspect, make an accusation, see result screen
6. Once full loop works: tag `phase2-single-player-prototype` and commit
7. Then: Phase 3 — lobby, ENet multiplayer, 75% clue-sharing

---

## Session 10 — April 2, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/start-godot-migration-mNrWD`
**Starting commit:** `ea5af2f`
**Status:** Complete — Phase 1 done (`phase1-backend-done`)

### What was done
Full Godot migration scaffolded. Project is now a multiplayer standalone game targeting
Steam, replacing the Streamlit creator tool. HuggingFace Spaces retired.

**Architecture decided:**
- Godot 4.x client (GDScript 2.0) — game UI, networking
- Python FastAPI backend — all Claude API calls (mystery generation, interrogation)
- Dedicated server model for multiplayer (Godot ENet, Phase 3)
- Steam via GodotSteam plugin (Phase 4)

**Files created:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server/main.py` | FastAPI app — `/generate`, `/interrogate`, `/rate`, `/mysteries`, `/health` |
| `server/requirements.txt` | fastapi, uvicorn, anthropic, python-dotenv |
| `server/Dockerfile` | Container — copies server + existing Python backend modules |
| `godot/project.godot` | Godot 4 project root; autoloads: GameState, ApiClient, NetworkManager |
| `godot/scripts/autoloads/GameState.gd` | Singleton: mystery, phase, history, accusation result |
| `godot/scripts/autoloads/ApiClient.gd` | HTTP wrapper; pooled HTTPRequest nodes per call |
| `godot/scripts/autoloads/NetworkManager.gd` | ENet multiplayer stub (Phase 3) |
| `godot/scripts/data/MysteryData.gd` | Typed GDScript wrapper for mystery JSON |
| `godot/scripts/ui/main_menu.gd` | MainMenu controller; health-checks backend on ready |
| `godot/scripts/ui/mystery_generation.gd` | Generation screen; calls /generate |
| `godot/scripts/ui/case_display.gd` | Case + evidence display; viability rating |
| `godot/scripts/ui/interrogation.gd` | Interrogation screen; calls /interrogate |
| `godot/scripts/ui/accusation.gd` | Accusation; compares locally vs solution dict |
| `godot/scripts/ui/result_screen.gd` | Result + solution reveal; calls /rate |
| `godot/scenes/ui/MainMenu.tscn` | MainMenu scene tree |
| `godot/scenes/ui/MysteryGeneration.tscn` | Generation scene tree |
| `godot/scenes/ui/CaseDisplay.tscn` | Case display scene tree |
| `godot/scenes/ui/Interrogation.tscn` | Interrogation scene tree |
| `godot/scenes/ui/Accusation.tscn` | Accusation scene tree |
| `godot/scenes/ui/ResultScreen.tscn` | Result scene tree |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Updated: Steam target, Godot architecture, retired HuggingFace |

**Files NOT modified (kept as-is):**
- `app.py` — retired (do not modify; will delete once Phase 2 confirmed)
- `mystery_generator.py`, `coherence_validator.py`, `part_registry.py`, `localization.py` — kept, used by FastAPI server

### Key decisions
- **Solution in client dict:** The `/generate` endpoint returns the full mystery including
  `solution`. The Godot client stores it in `GameState` but never displays it until the
  `ResultScreen`. Phase 3 will add server-side validation (`POST /accuse`) to prevent
  multiplayer cheating; Phase 2 compares locally.
- **No extra `/accuse` endpoint for Phase 2:** Simplification — accusation is a local
  comparison. The `POST /accuse` endpoint (Claude verdict narrative) is deferred to Phase 3.
- **NetworkManager is a stub:** All methods are present with Phase 3 annotations; Phase 2
  is single-player only.
- **HuggingFace retired:** `hf-deploy` branch is stale. Server runs locally via uvicorn.

### How to test Phase 1
```bash
# 1. Install server dependencies
cd server && pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start backend
cd /path/to/SocialGaming && uvicorn server.main:app --port 8000

# 3. Smoke test
curl localhost:8000/health
# → {"ok":true}

# 4. Open godot/ in Godot 4 editor
# 5. Verify 3 autoloads appear in Project → Project Settings → Autoload
# 6. Press F5 — MainMenu should load
```

### Next steps (resume here — Phase 2)
1. Open `godot/` in Godot 4 editor and verify scenes load without errors
2. Run the FastAPI server locally; press F5 in Godot; generate a mystery end-to-end
3. If any `@onready` node paths are wrong (scene tree mismatch), fix them in the editor
4. Once full single-player loop works: tag `phase2-single-player-prototype`
5. Then: Phase 3 — lobby system, ENet multiplayer, 75% clue-sharing

### Local sync steps
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout claude/start-godot-migration-mNrWD
git pull origin claude/start-godot-migration-mNrWD
```

## Session 9 — March 12, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/setup-api-and-mysteries-LRLQK`
**Latest commit:** `d66657d`

### Files modified
- `app.py` — Multiple UI improvements (see decisions below)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Streamlined and updated to reflect current state
- `SESSIONS.md` — This entry

### Decisions made
- **Page header** now has two caption lines: "Ultimately: ..." (game vision) and "Currently: ..." (creator tool). The "Currently" line is **owner-maintained** — Claude Code must not change it.
- **Evidence surfaced** — all evidence items now shown in an expandable section (open by default) with type badge and ★/✗/· relevance tags. Previously generated but never displayed.
- **Gameplay notes surfaced** — difficulty, estimated playtime, key twists now shown inline below evidence.
- **Witnesses** added to cast display in the narrative and to the interrogation dropdown (alongside suspects).
- **`crime.when`** now shown in the crime narrative.
- **Viability rating** — 1–10 horizontal radio buttons with a descriptive label per score. Creator-side only. Stored in session state; **not persisted to disk yet** (intentional — owner wants to play with it first).
- **Feedback persistence deferred** — saving ratings + behavioral signals to disk is on the backlog (SESSIONS.md item 7) but must not be implemented until the owner explicitly requests it.

### What is incomplete / next steps
1. **[DONE]** ~~Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to HuggingFace Space secrets~~ — completed March 12, 2026
2. **[START HERE]** Play-test — generate mysteries in the live Space, use the viability rating, verify full output looks right
3. ~~Full corpus run~~ — **DO NOT re-run**. Corpus run failures were caused by source material that is too brief or not a mystery — re-running will produce the same failures. The 1,469-part registry is the corpus; expand it only by adding new quality source texts.
4. Merge `claude/mystery-versioning-system-TPblK` (CLI + part registry) into main
5. Add "Load saved mystery" dropdown to `app.py`
6. **Multiplayer / invite mechanic** — see design decision below
7. **[LOW PRIORITY — do not implement until owner asks]** Feedback persistence: auto-save mystery to disk on generation, write `_feedback.viability_rating` back into the JSON. Extend to behavioral signals (time-to-solve, interrogation patterns, first-accusation accuracy) when ready. Consider HuggingFace Datasets API for multi-user deployment.

### Design decision — Multiplayer & invite mechanic
**Agreed direction (March 12, 2026):**
- The game is multi-player. The **initiator** creates and enters the mystery scenario.
- **Information sharing is global** — all players see the same 75% of information. Simple to begin with; no per-player asymmetry yet.
- **Invite mechanic:** use a **shareable link with a short game code** (e.g. `chooseyourmystery.com/game/XK7F2`). Host generates the mystery, gets a link/code, and shares it however they like (WhatsApp, text, email — host's choice). No email/SMS infrastructure needed on our side.
  - This is the Jackbox / Skribbl.io model — lowest friction, works in any group-chat context.
  - First-come-first-served on joining (no invite list to manage).
  - If a gated invite list is needed later it can be added, but start without it.
- **Do not implement yet** — design is captured here for the next session that picks up multiplayer work.

## Session 8 — March 12, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/review-changes-mmmec1tknjh846kb-08C3q`
**Latest commit:** `1f11171`

### Files created
- `coherence_validator.py` — P1 chain + witness interrogation foundation + scene investigation checks; two entry points (`check_parts` pre-generation, `check_mystery` post-generation); all issues carry `repair_hint` pointing to registry re-sample rather than new API call

### Files modified
- `cli.py` — wired both validator entry points into `cmd_generate`: `check_parts` runs after sampling (auto-retries targeted re-samples for blocking part gaps), `check_mystery` runs after generation and attaches `_coherence` summary to saved JSON
- `cli.py` — tightened `_generate_with_claude` prompt with explicit quality requirements and concrete examples for `alibi`, `secret`, and evidence fields
- `CLAUDE.md` — updated current to-do list (item 2 and 3 now reflect quality-validation and coherence-validator work)

### Decisions made
- Validator is **two-phase**: pre-generation (free, catches weak sampled parts before API call) and post-generation (verifies the full mystery JSON)
- `BLOCKING` issues prevent gameplay use; `WARNING` degrades quality; `INFO` is cosmetic
- Witness interrogation check anchors three question types: Q-ALIBI, Q-WHY (secret), Q-MOTIVE (suspects)
- Scene investigation requires ≥1 red-herring evidence to be `physical` or `documentary` so players find misdirection during scene investigation, not only from dialogue
- All repair hints reference `part_type` re-sampling from registry (zero API cost)

### What is incomplete / next steps
1. **[START HERE]** Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to HuggingFace Space settings so app.py can call Claude in production
2. Run `python cli.py generate` with API key to generate 5–10 real mysteries and confirm they pass the new validator (especially confirm no Victorian template default)
3. Wire `check_mystery` into `app.py` — currently only integrated in `cli.py`
4. Full corpus run: `python cli.py extract --protocol P1P2` (359 books → ~700 new parts)
5. Merge `claude/mystery-versioning-system-TPblK` once quality items validated
6. Add "Load saved mystery" dropdown to app.py (browse mysteries generated via CLI inside the UI)
7. **[LOW PRIORITY — do not implement until owner has played with it]** Player/creator feedback persistence: auto-save generated mystery to disk on generation (same slug+timestamp pattern as CLI), then write viability rating + any future behavioral signals (time-to-solve, interrogation patterns, first-accusation accuracy) back into the mystery JSON as `_feedback.*`. The data co-locates with the mystery and feeds back into part-registry weighting (high-rated mysteries → their parts sampled more). Consider HuggingFace Datasets API when app goes multi-user.

---

## Session 6 — March 9, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/upload-corpus-extraction-3uTq5`
**Latest commit:** `037d7a2`
**Status:** Complete

### What was done

**Unblocked corpus extraction via surrogate pipeline:**
- HuggingFace corpus cannot be fetched in this environment (network 403); pivoted to Option 2
- Built `extract_test_mysteries.py` — runs P1+P2 extraction against the 6 built-in test mysteries (A–F) as a surrogate for the full corpus pipeline
- Resolved auth: environment has no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` but does have a Bearer OAuth token at `/home/claude/.claude/remote/.session_ingress_token`; script uses Bearer when no API key is set
- All 6 mysteries extracted successfully: ~8k tokens total, saved to `mystery_database/extractions/test_{a-f}_p1p2.json`

**Conceptual clarification (important for next session):**
- Resolved the "template vs. game engine" question: the 6 test scenarios are *validation samples*, not templates. Templates = constraint rules. The P1–P4 taxonomy already encodes the constraint space. Full corpus extraction (Step 7) is what builds real constraint knowledge.
- The test extraction results confirm the extractor works correctly: high confidence on fields present in source (crime, closed_world, alibi), low confidence on fields absent (resolution, investigator) — this is correct behavior.

**Updated CLAUDE.md** with three standing design principles:
1. Close feedback loops (player signal, quality signal, part signal)
2. Preserve mystery coherence (P1 chain must be causally consistent before P2 is added)
3. Drive down cost (cache, test on 6 first, protocol triage, batch before prompting, dry-run)

### Files created or modified
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `extract_test_mysteries.py` | NEW — surrogate extractor for 6 test mysteries; Bearer token auth |
| `mystery_database/extractions/test_a_p1p2.json` | NEW — P1+P2 extraction for Mystery A |
| `mystery_database/extractions/test_b_p1p2.json` | NEW — P1+P2 extraction for Mystery B |
| `mystery_database/extractions/test_c_p1p2.json` | NEW — P1+P2 extraction for Mystery C |
| `mystery_database/extractions/test_d_p1p2.json` | NEW — P1+P2 extraction for Mystery D |
| `mystery_database/extractions/test_e_p1p2.json` | NEW — P1+P2 extraction for Mystery E |
| `mystery_database/extractions/test_f_p1p2.json` | NEW — P1+P2 extraction for Mystery F |
| `CLAUDE.md` | UPDATED — added Design Principles section (feedback loops, coherence, cost) |

### Key decisions
- **Test-first discipline**: always use `extract_test_mysteries.py` to validate extraction logic before touching the corpus pipeline
- **Bearer auth pattern**: `_get_token()` in `extract_test_mysteries.py` is the reference implementation for API calls without an explicit key in this environment
- **14MB parquet is small enough for GitHub** (under 100MB limit) — user should push `data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet` to unblock full corpus run

### Blockers
- **Corpus parquet not in repo**: user has it locally at `data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet` (14MB). To unblock Step 7: `git add mystery-crime-books/ && git push`
- **corpus_loader.py** expects parquet at `mystery-crime-books/train-00000-of-00001.parquet` or `mystery-crime-books/data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet`

### Resume from here
1. User pushes corpus parquet to repo → I fetch it → run `python cli.py extract --protocol P1P2 --end 10` → inspect quality
2. If quality OK → full run: `python cli.py extract --protocol P1P2` (359 books, ~700 new parts)
3. Wire `app.py` to `part_registry.py`
4. Deploy to HuggingFace Spaces

## Session 4 — March 8, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/document-research-findings-LdlIV`
**Latest commit:** 5e45b91
**Status:** Wrap-up / housekeeping

### What was done
- Validated API key and Anthropic credit balance — pipeline is unblocked and ready
- Diagnosed "no credit" false alarm: was a terminal caching issue; restarting Terminal resolved it
- Confirmed working tree clean, branch up to date with remote — no code changes needed
- No corpus data locally (parquet corpus lives on HuggingFace, not cloned)
- `mystery_database/` is fully synced to git (1 generated mystery + 48-part registry committed)

### Data sync status
| Data | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Code + registry | `claude/document-research-findings-LdlIV` | ✅ Pushed |
| Part taxonomy | `extraction_protocols.py`, `part_registry.py` | ✅ In git |
| Generated mysteries | `mystery_database/generated/` | ✅ Committed (1 file) |
| Corpus (359 books) | HuggingFace `AlekseyKorshuk/mystery-crime-books` | Remote-only, not cloned |
| Extraction outputs (--end 10 run) | Not saved — session ended before commit | ⚠️ Re-run needed |

### Next steps (resume here)
1. Re-run `python3 cli.py extract --protocol P1P2 --end 10` and inspect JSON output quality
2. If quality OK → full run: `python3 cli.py extract --protocol P1P2` (359 books, ~700 new parts)
3. Wire `app.py` to `part_registry.py` (replace freeform LLM generation with part registry RAG)
4. Deploy `app.py` to HuggingFace Spaces

---

## Session 3 — March 7, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/document-research-findings-LdlIV`
**Latest commit:** d39a3ca
**Status:** Complete

### What was done
- Fixed `corpus_loader.py` — two bugs blocking `python3 cli.py extract --protocol P1P2 --end 10`:
  1. Error message pointed to wrong clone URL (GitHub `Blutomania/mystery-crime-books` has no parquet); corrected to HuggingFace `AlekseyKorshuk/mystery-crime-books`
  2. HuggingFace clones nest the parquet under `data/` subdirectory; loader now checks `data/` first, falls back to repo root
- Extraction pipeline confirmed working — `--end 10` run completed successfully

### Next steps
- Inspect 10 extracted JSON files for P1/P2 field quality before full corpus run
- If quality is good: `python3 cli.py extract --protocol P1P2` (full 359-book run)
- Check API credit balance at console.anthropic.com before full run

---

## Session 2 — March 7, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/document-research-findings-LdlIV`
**Status:** Active

### What was done
- Committed `RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` — the writer-grounded mystery taxonomy (C1–C6, M1–M8, F1–F12, cross-writer consensus, P1–P4 extraction protocols)
- Built `app.py` — Streamlit UI adapted from the MysterySolver HuggingFace Space:
  - Swapped Groq/Llama for Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
  - Replaced "Generate" button with free-text prompt input
  - Mystery generation structured around P1 Skeleton Protocol (C1–C6)
  - Suspect extraction and solution grounded in P2 Architecture Protocol (M1, M2, M5, M6)
  - Coming Soon panel: AI depiction scenes, multiplayer, clue sharing, Gen AI avatars
- Updated `requirements.txt`: `anthropic>=0.40.0`, `streamlit>=1.35.0`

### Sources for taxonomy
Christie, P.D. James, Ronald Knox, Raymond Chandler, Tana French, Gillian Flynn, Ian Rankin

---

## Session 1 — March 7, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/mystery-versioning-system-TPblK`
**Status:** Complete (4 commits, latest fd0b320)

### What was built

**`extraction_protocols.py`** — Four-level mystery part taxonomy (P1–P4)

**`test_mysteries.py`** — Canonical test corpus (Mysteries A–F), 6 mysteries × 8 part types = 48 parts

**`part_registry.py`** — Atomization layer (the core missing piece)
- `PART_CONTENT` — text of all 48 parts, keyed by `SOURCE(INDEX)` notation e.g. `C(4)`, `F(2)`, `A(6)`
- `SETTING_COMPAT` — per-part compatibility rules (motives/red herrings universal; biometric/data-log parts require `far_future`; maritime parts require `victorian` or `maritime`)
- `MysteryPart.is_compatible()` — filters candidates against a free-text setting string
- `PartRegistry.sample_for_generation(max_per_source=2)` — diversity-constrained sampling, no single source dominates
- `ProvenanceRecipe.format()` — auditable recipe string stored with every output e.g. `C(1) + C(2) + F(3) + B(4) + A(5) + B(6) + A(7) + E(8)`

**`corpus_loader.py`** — Loads and parses the mystery corpus

**`run_corpus_pipeline.py`** — Extraction runner; delegates to `cli.py extract`

**`cli.py`** — Terminal entry point, 5 commands:
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python cli.py generate` | Interactive mystery generation — setting/crime/players, RAG, mystery + provenance recipe |
| `python cli.py generate --demo` | Same, no API key needed |
| `python cli.py solve` | MysterySolver mode — paste mystery, get structured deduction (culprit, red herrings, next steps) |
| `python cli.py list` | Browse canonical corpus (A–F) and all generated mysteries with recipes |
| `python cli.py registry` | Part inventory: 48 parts, diversity health |
| `python cli.py extract` | Delegates to `run_corpus_pipeline.py` |

**`mystery_database/`** — Committed with initial `part_registry.json` (48 parts) and first demo mystery (`the_murder_at_ancient_athens_…json`) with provenance recipe

**`.gitignore`** — Added; excludes `__pycache__/`, `.env`, `venv`, parquet corpus files, pipeline checkpoints

**`requirements.txt`** — Added `rich>=13.0.0`

### Five gaps closed
| Gap | Solution |
|---|---|
| CLI entry point | `cli.py` with 5 subcommands |
| Explicit part-level decomposition with ID tracking | `MysteryPart` + `PART_CONTENT` in `part_registry.py` |
| Diversity constraint (no single source dominates) | `sample_for_generation(max_per_source=2)` |
| Setting compatibility filter | `SETTING_COMPAT` table + `_parse_setting()` + `is_compatible()` |
| Part provenance tracking | `ProvenanceRecipe` → `C(1) + F(3) + B(6) + …` stored in every JSON |

## Consolidated To-Do List

### Immediate (pre-full corpus run)
- [ ] **Step 6** — Run `python cli.py extract --protocol P1P2 --end 10` to validate extraction quality on 10 books before committing to full 359-book run
- [ ] **Step 7** — Full corpus run: `python cli.py extract --protocol P1P2` — adds ~700 parts to registry, expands setting diversity beyond 6 test mysteries

### UI
- [ ] Wire `app.py` (Streamlit) to `part_registry.py` and `mystery_generator.py` so generated mysteries use the part registry rather than freeform LLM generation
- [ ] Deploy `app.py` to HuggingFace Spaces with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret
- [ ] Revise HuggingFace Spaces UI: confirm text input field is in place (done in Session 2)

### Content & Quality
- [ ] Manual validation of first 10 extracted mysteries before full corpus run
- [ ] Confirm demo mystery output stops using generic Victorian template — requires Step 7 corpus parts for setting-accurate generation (e.g. "Ancient Athens")
- [ ] Update extraction prompts in `mystery_data_acquisition.py` to map to P1–P4 protocol structure

### Architecture
- [ ] Merge `claude/mystery-versioning-system-TPblK` into working branch once Step 6/7 validated
- [ ] Evaluate PostgreSQL + pgvector migration path (trigger: >1,000 mysteries in registry)

## Session 7 — March 11, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/review-changes-mmmec1tknjh846kb-08C3q`
**Latest commit:** `501641c`

### What was done
- Deployed `app.py` to HuggingFace Spaces at `huggingface.co/spaces/blutomania/SocialGaming`
- Resolved HTTPS git auth failure — switched to SSH (`git@hf.co`) after protocol errors
- Created clean `hf-deploy` orphan branch (no PDF history) to satisfy HF binary file restrictions
- Removed `MysterySolver/` embedded git repo from tracking; added to `.gitignore`
- Added HuggingFace Space YAML metadata block to `README.md`
- Removed `sdk_version` pin from metadata (was causing streamlit version conflict in build)

### Files modified
- `README.md` — Added HF Space metadata header; removed sdk_version pin
- `.gitignore` — Added `MysterySolver/`

### Decisions
- SSH over HTTPS for HF remote pushes (HTTPS protocol.version errors on this machine)
- `hf-deploy` orphan branch as the HF deployment branch (keeps PDF-free history)
- No `sdk_version` in metadata — let HF resolve streamlit version automatically

### Next steps
1. **Verify the Space builds and runs** — check `huggingface.co/spaces/blutomania/SocialGaming`
2. **Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret** in HF Space settings (Settings → Variables and secrets)
3. Wire `app.py` to `part_registry.py` (marked in to-do above — partially done in `f205194`)
4. When pushing future fixes to HF: `git cherry-pick <commit>` onto `hf-deploy`, then `git push hf hf-deploy:main --force`

## Session 29 — August 12, 2026 (MYF: lobby progress, then eleven playtest changes)
**Branch:** `claude/myf-lobby-progress-state-zc3myh` (off `main` at `a8c86fb`)
**Scope:** Mind Your Friends only. No CYM files touched.

### What was done

**Part 1 — the reported "Start Game does nothing" bug (MYF CLAUDE.md item 36).**
Not an error: a ~250s silent wait. Fixed both halves in both backends.
- Fact-bank batches now run concurrently (`Promise.all` / `ThreadPoolExecutor`) instead of in a
  loop: ~250s → ~50s. Results still merged in batch order so an overlapping category resolves
  the same way it did before.
- Added `game.startProgress` — set before the first Claude request goes out, updated per
  completed batch, cleared on success or failure — riding the existing player-view broadcast, so
  every player in the room sees the wait narrated, not just the host.
- `ApiClient.gd`'s start timeout was 120s against a 250s call, so the Godot client timed out on
  every real game start. Now `START_GAME_TIMEOUT` (300s), with `GameState.gd` exposing
  `start_progress()`/`is_starting()` and a `start_progress_changed` signal.

**Part 2 — the owner's playtest notes.** The owner ran real games mid-session and returned
eleven notes. Three had genuine design forks in them and were put back to the owner before
building (wager model under open answering; fact-fetch timing; category source). All eleven are
built, **in the Next.js prototype only**. Full detail in MYF's `CLAUDE.md` item 37.
- Mechanics: open answering (everyone races, first correct wins, only the active player risks
  the wager), reading window + 40s clock, 8–20 word questions, one rule per round with round 1
  deliberately plain, 3 tappable categories, instant start via lazy per-category facts.
- UI: brand bar (title treatment left, per-game recoloured logo centre), two-column desktop
  layout with a 9:16 host slot, uniform illustrated cards, one-at-a-time superlative voting with
  Skip all.

### Files modified
**Backend/mechanics:** `lib/claudeClient.js`, `lib/gameState.js`, `lib/constants.js`,
`lib/roundRules.js`, `server.js`, `server_py/claude_client.py`, `server_py/game_state.py`,
`server_py/main.py` (Python side has Part 1 only — see the gap below)
**New:** `lib/categories.js`, `lib/logoPaths.js` (generated), `components/BrandBar.jsx`,
`components/Logo.jsx`, `components/HostStage.jsx`, `components/GameCard.jsx`,
`scripts/build-logo.mjs`, `scripts/mechanics-test.js`, `server_py/test_start_progress.py`,
`public/brand/logo-split.svg`
**UI:** `components/Lobby.jsx`, `components/GameBoard.jsx`, `components/CardHand.jsx`,
`components/CardPicker.jsx`, `components/SuperlativeVoting.jsx`, `app/game/[code]/page.js`,
`app/globals.css`
**Godot:** `godot/scripts/autoloads/ApiClient.gd`, `godot/scripts/autoloads/GameState.gd`,
`godot/scripts/ui/lobby.gd`, `godot/scripts/tests/game_start_smoke_test.gd`
**Docs:** MYF `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/WIRING.md`, `PLAYTEST.md` (new PT-4, PT-5)
**Deleted:** `scripts/start-progress-test.js` (its subject no longer exists)

### Decisions
- **Steal round rule retired**, along with the whole STEAL phase. Open answering *is* Steal,
  always on. Leaves eight round rules; whether a ninth is wanted is an open design call, and it
  can't be Steal again.
- **Reading window is a timestamp, not a phase.** Every phase-timeout and auto-advance helper in
  `gameState.js` assumes the existing loop; a tenth phase would mean auditing all of them.
- **Answer evaluations are serialized.** "First correct wins" has to mean first *submission* —
  concurrent evaluation hands the win to whoever's API call returns first and can pay two
  players for one question. Node gets the ordering from its event loop plus one promise chain;
  Python will need a real per-game answer queue.
- **Round 1 has no rule on purpose** — casual-first applied to onboarding.
- **Test seam added** (`__setClientForTests` in `claudeClient.js`). The race, the de-dup and the
  concurrency claims can't be tested against a real API whose timing is the variable under test.

### Verification
- `scripts/mechanics-test.js` — 51 assertions, zero API cost.
- `server_py/test_start_progress.py` — 21 assertions, zero API cost, asserts both backends emit
  the same `startProgress` shape.
- Godot 4.6 headless: `--import` compile check clean; `lobby_smoke_test` 21/21 against a real
  uvicorn; `game_start_smoke_test` extended with progress assertions, all passing.
- Real browser (Chromium, 3 players, desktop width): instant start, round-1 banner, reading
  countdown, a non-active player buzzing in to take the active player's question, plus the brand
  bar and illustrated card hand.

### Known gaps — read before picking this up
1. **`server_py` has none of Part 2.** It still has the STEAL phase, per-turn round rules, a
   blocking fact-bank build and 5 categories. The Godot client talks to `server_py`, so this
   blocks all Godot work. Porting order and the traps are in MYF's `docs/WIRING.md` → "The
   August 12 playtest changes".
2. **The changed game has not been played by people.** PT-4 and PT-5 are the two questions only
   a real table can answer.
3. **`scripts/coherence-test.js` is broken on `main`**, pre-existing — imports `POINT_TIERS`,
   removed from `lib/constants.js` when wagers became a range. Fixing it means deciding what
   wager values it should sample.

### Next steps
1. Play a real game with the new mechanics; answer PT-4 and PT-5.
2. Port Part 2 to `server_py`, with a Python equivalent of `mechanics-test.js`.
3. Then the Godot category/card screens — built against 3 categories and the curated grid.

## Session 30 — August 17, 2026 (MYF: loose-end audit, branch truth, aesthetic direction opened)

**Branch:** `claude/mindyourfriends-game-ui-clqce8`
**Starting commit:** `a8c86fb` (tip of `main`) — see the branch note below, this was wrong
**Status:** Paused by owner mid-design-exploration; nothing half-built in code

### Branch hazard, caught at session start
The harness assigned a **fresh branch off `main`**, not the previous session's branch. Session 29's
six MYF commits were sitting on `claude/myf-lobby-progress-state-zc3myh`, unmerged, **with no open
PR** (the repo had zero open PRs). That is the same auto-assignment failure documented for CYM on
July 9 and for MYF on July 22 — third occurrence. The assigned branch happened to sit exactly at
those commits' base, so it was fast-forwarded rather than started in parallel. **Check this every
session; do not trust the handed branch name.**

### Loose-end audit (owner asked for verification before new work)
Ran, rather than assumed:
- `scripts/mechanics-test.js` — all pass (zero API cost), incl. rebus bank integrity (82 puzzles).
- `server_py/test_start_progress.py` — all pass, incl. its cross-backend parity assertion.
- All JS and Python sources parse/compile; no `TODO`/`FIXME` markers anywhere in MYF source.
- Chain spec in `GAME_DESIGN.md` is complete — three mechanical notes + two open questions.
- **Item 36's Godot consequence is already closed:** `ApiClient.gd` carries
  `START_GAME_TIMEOUT = 300.0`. It was still being tracked as open.

**One real find, fixed (`c4f201f`):** the rebus commit left a duplicated copy of the rebus
view-building block inside `playerView()`'s RESULT/GAME_OVER branch, with its own redundant phase
check. Dead rather than wrong — it set exactly what the first copy set — but it read as if
reveal-time rebus data came from a separate path.

**Sharpened item 1 (`server_py` parity):** it is not a missing-features gap, it encodes a
*different game*. Base timer 20s vs 40s, 5 categories vs 3, still has retired `steal` and no
`rebus`, no reading phase. A Godot client built against it today would target the pre-playtest
design.

### `dev/cryptic-challenge` is not a third project (`b7b1f43`)
Verified against refs, not the name: it points at `ea5af2f` — **the same commit
`dev/choose-your-mystery` points at** — a March 2026 snapshot of CYM's pre-Godot Streamlit tree,
zero unique commits vs `main`. No file named "cryptic" has ever existed on any branch, and no
commit message mentions it. Recorded in **both** projects' `CLAUDE.md` at the owner's request,
since either project's next session could repeat the misreading (this session did, initially,
citing it as evidence of a third studio title). Deletion still needs the GitHub UI — `git push
--delete` hits the same 403 as `main`, and a Session 30 attempt was also blocked by the permission
classifier. Caveat recorded too: if a real Cryptic Challenge project exists, **its work is not in
this repo**, so deleting the pointer archives nothing.

Also noted: `dev/mind-your-friends` is now at **zero unique commits vs `main`** — a stale pointer
rather than a live branch. Documented only; Session 18 marked it do-not-touch.

### Aesthetic direction opened (MYF item 39)
Owner supplied a reference background — faded question marks, randomly sized/strewn/rotated, on
white — and scoped the aesthetic work to **MYF only**. Decided: ship it as an image asset, not a
generator (the "different screen shapes" argument for generating was raised and **withdrawn as
wrong** — a scattered texture has no composition to crop). Export as 2× WebP/PNG, not SVG, on the
evidence of this repo's own 2.1 MB and 1.2 MB brand SVGs.

**Owner paused here** to explore the same treatment on **grey, charcoal and slate blue** — white
may not work. Full detail, including the palette consequences and the working "paper and objects"
thesis, in MYF `CLAUDE.md` item 39.

### Aesthetic direction — settled in-session (MYF items 39/40)
Owner explored white, then grey/charcoal/slate, and landed on **slate blue `#2F4459`** with faded
question marks at **10% mark strength** over a dense field. Formalised as tokens in
`tailwind.config.js`, not just prose. Key derived rules, all recorded in MYF `CLAUDE.md` item 40:
- **The plate device** (from a Mapme reference deck the owner supplied): text sits on a rectangle
  of *the ground colour with the texture switched off* — a hole cut through the field, not a panel
  on top. No radius, border or shadow. Ground and plate are **one token**, deliberately.
- **Mark strength and the plate device are the same decision.** The plate is only visible because
  the texture around it isn't, so the two can't be tuned independently. If a real television needs
  more separation, **add density, not opacity**.
- Host video = a **centre-screen takeover**, not a persistent window (owner's call, on cost).
  Because it replaces play content rather than sharing space, nothing reflows — which was the one
  real objection to making it non-permanent. Vertical originates on the phone.
- Host is **one character whose attitude varies** (snarky/rude/obscene), not a per-game custom
  host — this is what makes pre-packaged animation viable. Clip carries the attitude, names arrive
  as text. Flagged: "funny" is the one attitude that fights the model, since a joke is a one-shot
  and a posture isn't.
- Hold screen while a clip loads = **standings + a score-progression chart**, not a spinner.
  Player colours generated in OKLCH and **validated** against the slate ground (lightness, chroma,
  contrast, CVD) at 4 and 8 players — fixed order, must not be reordered.

### Flow B — the round loop, agreed this session (MYF item 41)
The owner walked a three-player hypothetical ("Flow A") through the live rules, which made **PT-4**
concrete: under the Aug 12 free-for-all, a faster player takes the question and the active player's
wager never bites. Worse, it breaks "I Cut, You Choose" — if anyone can claim the wager, the setter
is placing a **bounty they might collect themselves**, so they'd always set maximum.

**Flow B** (full spec in `GAME_DESIGN.md` → "The Round Loop"): after the 5s reading window the
active player gets an **exclusive ~8s window** on their own question. Right → wins the wager.
Wrong → loses it, buzzer opens. Pass → buzzer opens immediately, costs nothing. Everyone else then
races for a flat 100, one attempt each. **Answering never earns another turn** (the runaway-leader
failure in the rejected Flow A).

Two things worth not re-deriving:
- **Pass ≠ timeout.** An explicit pass is free; letting the window expire still costs the wager,
  preserving `expireAnswerWindow`'s "stalling isn't free" rule. Without the split, pass becomes a
  free opt-out of every hard question and the wager stops mattering again.
- Also corrected a **stale Round Loop section** in `GAME_DESIGN.md` that still described the
  pre-Aug-12 single-answerer loop.

### `server_py` port — started, deliberately paused (MYF item 42)
The blocker the owner asked about. Two backends exist: `server.js` (Next.js prototype, where all
design work lands) and `server_py/` (**what Godot talks to**). Every change since Aug 12 went into
the first only, so `server_py` encodes a *different game* — 20s timer vs 40, 5 categories vs 3,
retired Steal still present, no reading window. Any Godot screen built today targets a game that
no longer exists.

**Landed:** constants, round rules (Steal out, Rebus in, `NO_RULE`, no-repeat picker,
`MYF_FORCE_ROUND_RULE`), and the rebus bank — **generated** from `lib/rebusData.js` via a new
`scripts/build-rebus-py.mjs` rather than hand-typed, since 113 pieces and 82 puzzles retyped is a
silent-divergence machine. Passes the same integrity checks as the JS suite.
Also fixed `test_start_progress.py`, which hardcoded `15` categories and so silently encoded the
old 5-category game.

**Paused on purpose** at a clean boundary: the next piece is the answer flow, and Flow B replaces
it. Porting the Aug 12 flow and then immediately rewriting it would build the same mechanic twice.

### Next steps
1. **Build Flow B in the Next.js prototype** (MYF item 41) — the only place it can be played.
   Then play it: PT-4's watch-list is now Flow B's test list, and PT-5 needs the same table.
   The 8s exclusive window is the number most likely to be wrong.
2. **Resume the `server_py` port** (item 42) once Flow B settles. The hard part is unchanged:
   "first correct wins" must mean first *submission*, not first API response — Python needs a real
   per-game answer queue, and the evaluation must not hold `_games_lock` while it waits.
3. **Optional, cheap:** the "open answering" → "buzz-in" rename (item 43). One atomic pass, never
   mixed into the port.
4. Owner action, one click: delete `dev/cryptic-challenge` (and optionally `dev/mind-your-friends`)
   via the GitHub UI — both are stale pointers with zero unique commits.

## Session 38 — August 28, 2026 (CYM: the design becomes visible in the editor; two engine-side checks)

**Branch:** `claude/godot-game-rendering-i29xsh`, from `b76a994`. Owner's ask: *"get the game to
start rendering (in design) in Godot"*, then a to-do list.

**First, the constraint is now tested rather than assumed.** Previous sessions recorded "no Godot
binary in the session environment" as a fact. It was worth one attempt: outbound HTTPS here is
allowlist-only (pypi, npm, and GitHub scoped to this one repo). `godotengine.org` and the
TuxFamily mirror do not resolve at all, and `github.com/godotengine/...` returns 403 from the
proxy's repo scoping. **There is no route to an engine from this session**, headless included, so
everything below is still static work — but that sentence is now a measurement.

### Why the editor showed nothing, and what fixes it

Session 37 built the whole theme and it was invisible while being worked on. The cause is one
line: `Style.gd` assigns the theme to `get_tree().root`, and there is no root at *design* time.
Open any of the eight scenes in the editor and you get engine grey. Godot's project-wide default
theme (`gui/theme/custom`) *is* honoured by the editor canvas, but it has to be a Resource on
disk, and `Style.gd`'s header gives two good reasons not to hand-write one — it would be a fourth
copy of the palette, and a `.tres` is the same text format that cost Session 36 five panels.

**Both objections are about hand-writing it, so it is not hand-written.**
`godot/scripts/tools/ApplyTheme.gd` is an `EditorScript`: it calls `Style.build_theme()` — the
same function the game uses — and lets `ResourceSaver` serialise the result to
`res://assets/theme/cym_theme.tres`, then points `gui/theme/custom` at it. The `.tres` is a
**generated preview of `Style.gd`, never a source.** One keystroke (File → Run) regenerates it
after any change to `palette.py` or `Style.gd`.

Runtime is unaffected in either direction, which is the property that makes this safe: a Control
resolves its theme by walking ancestors *before* falling back to the project default, so
`Style.gd`'s root assignment still wins when the game runs. A stale `.tres` can mislead the
editor; it cannot ship a wrong colour.

`gui/theme/custom` is deliberately **not** pre-set in `project.godot` — pointing it at a file that
does not exist yet would error on a fresh clone. The script sets it only after writing the file.

### The guard Session 37 said could not be written

Session 37 recorded that a wrong theme item name is a silent no-op — no error, no warning, the
control just keeps its engine default — and that "short of running Godot there cannot be" a check
for it. There can, from inside Godot: `ThemeDB.get_default_theme()` declares every item the
engine really has, so every name `Style.gd` sets can be looked up in it. `ApplyTheme.gd` walks
the built theme's types (resolving each variation against its base type) and prints every colour,
font, font size, constant and stylebox the engine does not know. **Each miss is a line of
`Style.gd` doing nothing.** That turns Session 37's ten unverifiable control types into a list
the owner reads once.

### The other half: reading a scene is not loading it

`godot/scripts/tools/VerifyScenes.gd` is the second `EditorScript`. It parses each `.tscn` for the
nodes it *declares*, then instantiates the scene through the engine's own loader and asks the
resulting tree which of them really exist — the exact comparison that would have caught Session
36's `Interrogation.tscn`, where the checker saw all 21 declared nodes and five panels were null
at runtime. It also reports a scene whose root lost its script, which is what a GDScript parse
error looks like from the outside: no exception, no missing node, just a screen where nothing
responds — how the result screen reached a playtest blank.

`instantiate()` is safe to run here: `_ready()` and `@onready` both wait for a tree, and nothing
is added to one, so the check fetches nothing and touches no state.

The `.tscn` parsing in both scripts was validated against all eight real scenes before it shipped
(every root found, every root script found, plausible child counts) rather than being written
blind.

### Three Python docstrings in GDScript

Found by sweeping for the Session 36 defect classes:

```gdscript
func connect_ws(game_id: String, player_id: String) -> void:
    """Open a persistent WebSocket to /ws/{game_id}. ..."""
```

**Not fatal, and the honest description matters.** GDScript *does* have triple-quoted multiline
strings, so this parses. What it does not have is docstrings — a string alone on a line is a
standalone expression, evaluated, discarded, and logged as `STANDALONE_EXPRESSION`. Two of the
three were in `ApiClient.gd`, an autoload. So: three warnings in the Output panel that
`docs/F5_CHECKLIST.md` tells you to read for the `Style:` font canary. A procedure that says
"check Output for warnings" is worth less for every warning already sitting there that is fine.
Converted to `##`, which is what the other ~145 doc lines in the client use.

`config/icon` was the same shape of problem and is now unset: it named
`res://assets/ui/icon.png`, which has never existed, so every open and every run put a failed-load
**error** into that same panel. Godot falls back to its own icon silently. Restoring it is part of
item 17's open brand decision.

### `check_godot_wiring.py` — wider, and one stale claim corrected

- New `check_python_docstrings()`.
- **The parse-level checks now run over all 18 `.gd` files, not just the 8 a `.tscn` names.** The
  four autoloads, `MysteryData.gd` and the theme scripts had never been checked — and an autoload
  is the worst place to miss a parse error, since nothing at all runs if one fails.
- `check_implicit_concat`'s docstring claimed "a triple-quoted block spanning lines could match;
  none exist in this project today." That was **false at three call sites** when it was written.
  Corrected in place, and both checks were negative-tested by injecting each defect and confirming
  a non-zero exit before restoring the file.

### Status — say this plainly

**Still nothing rendered.** Every claim above is static or engine-side-but-unrun. The two
`EditorScript`s are the first two steps of `docs/F5_CHECKLIST.md` now, and they are the things
that convert Session 36's and Session 37's open caveats into answers — but only when the owner
runs them. Seven Python checkers pass, which Session 36's rule still says is necessary and not
sufficient.

### Second half — the documents, after the owner asked why a design question was unreadable

The owner tried to work `docs/INVESTIGATION_DESIGN.md` §6 and could not tell what question 1 was
asking. They were right, and the cause was not the question.

**§6 posed a three-way choice and the same document answered it twice, differently.** Line 50 asks
what a line on the connection map means; line 87 says *"in APF the map is presentation, not
mechanic"*; line 177 says *"it answers what is a line — provenance."* Two of the three readings had
lost their mechanic outright: narrative access is traversal, provenance comes only from §3's
growing pool, and APF deletes both. **Four of the five open questions turned out to be pre-APF** —
affordance display justified itself by "turning blind exploration into informed allocation",
player-position visibility presumes players are *at* locations, the budget model presumes an
investigation budget. Only "titles that spoil" survives.

Root cause: `CLAUDE.md` item 23 had already reduced §7's build order for APF. Nobody did the same
pass on §6. **The build order knew about APF; the open questions did not.**

Owner's decision on the live question underneath question 1 — whether the playtest draws a crime
scene at all: **(a), no picture**, a list of named findings, on the grounds that anything more
costs more for minimal playtest benefit.

### The rewrite the owner then asked for

Owner: *"long documents that often contain contradictions are messy and an unnecessary annoyance."*
Measured before acting, and the file they named was not the problem:

| Doc | Lines | Staleness markers |
|---|---:|---:|
| **CLAUDE.md** | **1,009** | **38** |
| docs/WIRING.md | 1,042 | 7 |
| docs/PLAYTEST_FLOW.md | 312 | 2 |

`PLAYTEST_FLOW.md` is one of the healthiest documents in the repo. `CLAUDE.md` had roughly four
times the contradiction density of anything else **and is auto-loaded into every session**, and 603
of its 1,009 lines were an archive under "Older items, kept for history". Owner chose a full
rewrite over a mechanical split.

**Executed as: rewrite the operating instructions, move the history verbatim.** `docs/DECISIONS.md`
(new) holds all 25 items in numeric order with an index; nothing was summarised away. `CLAUDE.md`
is now 405 lines of what is true today.

**What the rewrite corrected — these were all live falsehoods in the file every session reads:**

- **The stated core innovation did not exist.** The overview asserted a shared clue "reaches exactly
  75% of other players (randomly)". No code has ever done that. `server/main.py` has a
  player-chosen level against a per-difficulty minimum — `share_min` 0.70/0.60/0.50, no randomness.
  Session 21 found this and recorded it in item 11; the opening paragraph was never fixed, so the
  false version stayed in the first thing anyone read for seventeen sessions.
- **The architecture diagram listed 5 endpoints. There are 31.**
- **Three autoloads listed; there are four** — `Style` was added in Session 37.
- **`NetworkManager.gd` (ENet) is registered as an autoload and called by nothing** — no `.gd` or
  `.tscn` outside the file references it. The live transport is the FastAPI WebSocket the phone
  client uses. The file previously named ENet as *the* multiplayer mechanism in one section and
  WebSocket in another.
- **"1,469-part corpus"** — the registry holds **5,990 parts across 573 sources**.
- **"Current phase: Phase 3d"** — four stages out of date.
- The checker table, which is operational, sat *between items 18 and 19* in the middle of the
  history.

**Nothing was dropped by accident, and that was checked rather than asserted.** A coverage script
compared every backticked literal in the old file against the new pair: 46 were absent on the first
pass, and the ones with real value were restored — the commit-tag table, the caching inventory, the
session ingress token path, the icon-sheet splitter, and the `deprecated/` file list, which earns
its place because `deprecated/requirements.txt` and `mystery_generator.py` look exactly like files
someone would open by mistake.

**`scripts/check_decisions.py` (new)** stops the specific rot from returning: an item labelled open
while another item says it is finished (**item 21 was exactly this** — `[OPEN]` and "a stage-1
playtest-killer" while item 23 said APF deleted it), a duplicate or missing item number, and a
cited item number resolving to nothing. It found a real dangling reference on its first run
(`docs/WIRING.md:638`), which turned out to be a legitimate cross-project citation of MYF's item 31
— so it now leaves MYF-qualified references alone. Negative-tested on all three failure modes.

**The rule now written at the top of `CLAUDE.md`:** a design document states what is true now,
`SESSIONS.md` states what was decided when, `docs/DECISIONS.md` states why a numbered item exists.
A "superseded" marker inside `CLAUDE.md` is the signal that the text has become history.

### Third part — WIRING.md, solvability, and the F5 walkthrough

Owner set three next steps in order. All three landed.

**1. `docs/WIRING.md`.** Not rewritten — it is a reference and its length is earned. What it lacked
was any signal about which parts describe running code, so every section now carries a status
(LIVE / BUILT, NEVER RUN / NOT BUILT / DEFERRED) with an index at the head. Three claims were
false: the cinematic-brief trigger was documented as a Streamlit checkbox in *app.py* and a
`--cinematic` flag in *cli.py*, **both of which are in `deprecated/`** and were retired with the
Godot migration; the Localization section said *"Always runs"* and then, 37 lines later, that the
call is skipped for modern settings (the second is right); and the data flow still said a
1,469-part corpus against a registry holding 5,990 parts over 573 sources.

`check_doc_claims.py` gained the check that would have caught the first: it verified a referenced
file exists *somewhere*, so `app.py` passed on the strength of `deprecated/app.py`. It now fails a
reference resolving **only** into `deprecated/` unless the prose names it — which is why CLAUDE.md
can still list every file in there by name.

**2. Solvability as arithmetic (§4).** Built §4's proposed free interim check
(`scripts/check_solvability.py`) and ran it on all 17 generated mysteries. **The proposed check
finds nothing** — 0 of 17 list a key item the reasoning ignores. **The gap is the other way, in 16
of 17:** the reasoning cites evidence `key_evidence` does not contain, 55 items in total, up to 6
in one mystery. That matters because APF's constrained deal is specified over "the evidence that
proves the case"; read from `key_evidence`, the deal can satisfy all three of its constraints and
still leave the player short of what the solution reasons from.

Two measurements bound the `exonerates` change: **86% of non-culprit suspects are already named in
the reasoning**, so the field formalises existing prose rather than asking for something new; and
**16 of 17 mysteries have 2–3 suspects against the four `PLAYTEST_FLOW` specifies** — not
cosmetic, because eliminating to one needs S−1 exonerations, so the suspect count caps how many
findings are provably load-bearing and therefore how many players can hold one.

Also found: **PLAYTEST_FLOW's third deal constraint is not well-formed.** *"Becomes solvable once
the minimum share threshold is met"* — but `share_min` is a minimum *fraction of a player's own
findings* and the player picks which, so meeting it does not determine what reaches the pool, and
they will withhold the most valuable item, which is the mechanic working. Three options written up
for the owner; all are deal-time set arithmetic and none costs an API call.

**3. `docs/F5_CHECKLIST.md` rebuilt as one linear procedure**, 21 steps, every terminal command
included — clone, venv, pip, the free checker suite, uvicorn, the curl health check, port
conflicts, the key export for the paid steps. The old document put setup in an appendix, including
a section headed *"Step 0 — do this first"* that sat **after step 17**; the renumbering is recorded
so Session 36's walked steps 1–15 map to 9–19. Stale facts fixed: three autoloads became four, and
the missing-icon noise entry is gone because the icon path is now unset.

**The documented commands were run verbatim rather than written from memory**, which caught one:
globbing `scripts/check_*.py` sweeps in `check_brand_contrast.py`, which measures `brand/` artwork,
needs Pillow, and exits non-zero without it. A red line the reader is told to ignore is worse than
no line, so the loop names its checkers explicitly and says why.

### Fourth part — the share rule had two implementations

Owner asked whether players are actually told which finding is valuable. They are not, on the
multiplayer path: a finding is `{id, where it came from, prose}` — no `relevance`, no score, **and
no evidence ID**. That last one is a prerequisite nobody had listed: the solvability arithmetic is
defined over `evidence[]` and what a player holds has no join key to it, so the constrained deal
cannot be built until findings carry the evidence ID they came from.

The single-player route does the opposite: `case_display.gd` prints **★ critical** and **✗ red
herring** beside every evidence item, so the solo screen labels exactly what the multiplayer screen
hides. Flagged as a decision, not changed.

**Chasing it turned up a real bug.** The share minimum was implemented twice — `round()` on the
server, `ceili()` in `share_selection.gd`. They disagree in **6 of 18** realistic combinations and
**the client is always stricter**, so it refused to submit shares the server would have accepted.
At a two-finding hand it demanded both, and at APF's three-finding hand on EASY it demanded all
three — deleting the hoarding decision at exactly the hand size APF specifies.

Owner approved the unambiguous half: **the server computes it once and sends it.**
`_min_share_required()` is now the only definition, it is returned with every finding response
(investigate-area, follow-lead, interrogate-witness), `GameState` records it per phase, and
`share_selection.gd` displays it. When the server sends nothing the client falls back to **1, the
server's own floor** — erring permissive costs a rejected submit, erring strict silently deletes a
legal move. `scripts/test_share_rule.py` asserts the duplication is gone rather than that two
copies happen to agree; negative-tested by restoring the old line.

**The larger finding, left as the owner's decision:** at a three-finding hand the difficulty ladder
does not exist. EASY 0.70, MEDIUM 0.60 and HARD 0.50 all resolve to "share 2, keep 1" — a
percentage has no resolution over three items. Keep 0 deletes the mechanic and keep 2 means sharing
one thing, so keep 1 is forced and **difficulty has to live somewhere other than the share rule.**
The redundancy option from §4 is the natural home; suspect count and red-herring density are the
alternatives.

### Fifth part — generation writes the mystery backwards

**Owner's insight, and it was better than the checker it was offered against.** A mystery is
written solution first — killer, motive, then clues planted in reverse toward a truth already
fixed. The prompt was doing the exact opposite: its JSON template emitted `solution` **last**,
after the cast and the evidence, so the model invented a cast, committed to clues, and then
improvised an explanation for what it had already written.

**Mechanical, not stylistic.** A model composes left to right, so whatever it emits first is what
everything after is conditioned on. Solution last means the solution is conditioned on the clues.
The adage is a statement about conditioning order, which is why it carries from novels to a
language model unchanged.

**Measured harm.** `daggers_in_the_forum` scores `passed=True, blocking=0, warnings=0` — a clean
sweep of all 26 coherence rules — and its deduction turns on Apolonios, Demetrios and Senator
Manilius, none of whom are in its own character list. Writing forwards, when the cast does not
support the chain, inventing a person is cheaper than revising a cast already emitted. Across the
corpus **7 of 17 mysteries reason about a person absent from `characters[]`**, and every coherence
rule passes them, because 24 of the 26 check presence or counts and the two that do referential
integrity check structured fields, never prose.

**Changed:** `solution` now follows `setting`; `crime.what_happened` is marked public and may not
spoil; `solution.chain` numbers the deduction; each evidence item declares `supports`,
`exonerates`, `implicates`. The last two are §4's solvability fields, **bundled deliberately** —
testing generation costs money and one paid round beats two. Flagged as a widening of the approved
scope rather than done quietly.

**Why declaring links is the point:** the same move `exonerates` already made for the arithmetic —
stop asking a checker to infer a relationship, make generation state one. Narrative coherence
becomes graph reachability, checkable at zero API cost.

**What it does not buy, stated in the code and the docs:** a model can emit `supports: ["S2"]` on a
clue that does not support S2 and nothing structural can tell. The reorder changes the *direction*
of drift — away from a fixed solution it produces a clue that does not fit, which shows as an
unresolved link; toward an improvised solution it produces invented people, which is invisible. A
visible failure mode replaces an invisible one.

`scripts/check_narrative.py` reports CAST, LINKS and ORPHAN, and fails only on current-schema
mysteries so the legacy corpus does not hold the suite red.
`scripts/test_narrative_checks.py` proves the LINKS branch fires on eight fixtures — necessary
because no mystery on disk declares links yet, and a branch with no input is a branch nobody ran.

**Also corrected this session:** the earlier claim that 16 of 17 mysteries have too few suspects
implied generation ignores the spec. The rule *EXACTLY 4 suspects* was added 2026-08-21 and
sixteen of those mysteries are from March; the one generated under the current prompt has exactly
four. Corpus age, not drift.

**Untested against a real generation** — that costs credits, and it is the next paid step.

## Session 37 — August 26, 2026 (CYM: one palette, three surfaces; the client stops being default grey)

**Starting point:** `claude/mystery-game-aesthetics-ud0zrf`, off `main` at `93464bc` (PR #32 merged).
Owner asked for aesthetics work.

### The finding: there were three palettes, and the documented one was the one nobody rendered

Before touching anything, an inventory of what actually decides a colour in this product:

| Where | Ground | Accent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brand/README.md`, `scripts/check_brand_contrast.py`, `background_field.py` | slate `#2F4459` | brass `#C9A227` | documented as **"the one rule these assets must satisfy"** — and wired to no client |
| `server/static/mobile.html` | navy `#1a1a2e` | brass `#c8a96e` | the phone every player looks at |
| Godot host screen | none | none | default engine grey — this is what *"it ran, it's ugly"* was describing |

A fourth turned up mid-session: `scripts/preview_crime_scene_map.py` opened with
`GROUND = "#2b2f36"  # CYM slate`, which is not the slate. A preview whose stated job is
"judge the aesthetic by looking at it" was drawing in the wrong palette.

The two brasses are the tell. `#c8a96e` against `#C9A227` is close enough to look like a
rounding difference and far enough apart to see side by side — which, in CYM specifically,
is guaranteed: the Godot host screen and the phone clients are **in the same room at the
same time**. `brand/README.md`'s own opening paragraph predicts exactly this failure and
gives the reason the source artwork does not live inside either client's folder. The same
argument applies to the colours, so they now live in one place too.

### What was built

**`palette.py` — the single source of truth.** Slate ground (not a fresh choice: it is the
value the brand docs, the contrast checker and `background_field.py`'s five mark colours
were all already built against). A surface ramp that goes **deeper** than the ground rather
than lighter, for two structural reasons: the BACKGROUND field is painted on the ground, so
panels must sink for the texture to stay behind everything; and CYM's screens are far more
text-dense than MYF's, and slate is a mid-tone.

`CONTRAST_CONTRACT` holds 28 ink/background pairs with their WCAG floors, and
`scripts/test_palette.py` walks it. Six pairs failed on the first pass and were re-pitched by
walking lightness at fixed hue until the floor was met, rather than by eye.

**The semantic colours are lighter than a semantic colour usually looks, and that is forced
rather than chosen.** On a mid-slate ground a saturated red cannot reach 4.5:1 — Material's
own dark-theme error `#CF6679` manages 3.49:1 on our panel tier. The choice is between a red
that reads and a red that looks like a red.

**`scripts/build_palette.py`** generates `godot/scripts/theme/Palette.gd` and the CSS
custom-property block in `mobile.html`; `--check` fails on drift. It also **checks** (does
not generate) the ground in `project.godot`, because the Godot editor rewrites that file
itself — Session 36 recorded 4.7.2 re-saving it just for being opened — so splicing into it
would fight the engine for ownership.

**`godot/scripts/autoloads/Style.gd`** builds the Theme in GDScript and assigns it to
`get_tree().root.theme`, which every Control inherits. **One assignment restyles all eight
screens with no `.tscn` node tree edited to get it** — which matters beyond tidiness, since
editing scene files is where the last session's defects lived. Written as a script rather
than a `.tres` for two reasons: a `.tres` would be a fourth uncheckable copy of the palette,
and it is authored in the same text format that cost Session 36 five panels.

The **ground is set as the viewport clear colour** in `project.godot`, not painted by a node.
It is up before the first Control exists, so there is no frame of engine grey at startup —
and it is exactly the "ground colour alone until a mystery is named" state item 17 specifies.

**Thirteen theme type variations** (`DisplayLabel`, `MysteryTitleLabel`, `PrimaryButton`,
`DangerButton`, `QuietButton`, `CautionLabel`, …), applied across 51 nodes in all 8 scenes.
The default Button is deliberately the **quiet** one: these screens carry five or six buttons
at once, and if the default were brass every screen would shout.

**The scripts were tinting with raw web colours** — `Color.RED`, `Color.GOLDENROD`,
`Color.CORNFLOWER_BLUE`, `Color.SKY_BLUE`, `Color.ORANGE_RED`, `Color.GOLD`. Seventeen sites,
now palette constants. They also used `modulate`, which **multiplies a whole subtree** and
only ever looked right because the default font happened to be white; against a themed ink it
darkens rather than recolours. Labels now use `add_theme_color_override("font_color", …)`;
`modulate` is kept only where it genuinely tints a whole row.

**`scripts/preview_background_field.py`** — item 17 says the field's mark strength is *"NOT
SETTLED BY ARGUMENT — test on a real screen"*, and until now nothing drew it, so that
instruction could not be taken. `background_field.py` has been on disk, tested, and wired to
nothing. The preview renders the field at 1280×720 with a real screen's text over it at the
real sizes, prose both on the ground (the hard case) and on a panel, so the question being
asked is the right one: not "is the field nice" but "can you still read a case brief through
it". `--sheet` renders the shortest and longest real titles on disk, because the density
generator absorbs title length and the failure modes are at the ends.

### The new guard

`check_godot_wiring.py` now cross-checks every `theme_type_variation` in a `.tscn` against
the variations `Style.gd` declares. This is the one part of the styling a scene has to name,
and **Godot's own failure here is silent and mild** — an undeclared variation falls back to
the base type, so a typo yields a label that is merely unstyled, with no error anywhere. Mild
is what makes it worth checking: nothing will ever draw attention to it.

Verified in both directions, as were the palette-sync check, the clear-colour check and the
COLOURS-coverage test.

### What is NOT verified, and cannot be from here

**No Godot binary exists in this environment, so none of the theme has been rendered.**
Session 36's lesson applies to this session's work more than to most: the checkers confirm
that every variation name is declared and every path resolves, and they cannot confirm that
a theme item name is one Godot recognises. A wrong item name in `Style.gd` is a silent no-op
— the control keeps its engine default and nothing errors. That is the residual risk here,
it is bounded (it looks unstyled, it does not crash), and it needs an F5 to close.

`docs/F5_CHECKLIST.md`'s existing steps all still apply; what they now additionally check is
that each screen is themed.

### Files changed

- `palette.py` — new, the source of truth
- `scripts/build_palette.py`, `scripts/test_palette.py`, `scripts/preview_background_field.py` — new
- `scripts/check_godot_wiring.py` — theme-variation cross-check
- `scripts/preview_crime_scene_map.py` — reads `palette.py` instead of its own seven literals
- `godot/scripts/theme/Palette.gd` — new, generated
- `godot/scripts/autoloads/Style.gd` — new, the Theme
- `godot/project.godot` — `Style` autoload; ground as `default_clear_color`
- all 8 `godot/scenes/ui/*.tscn` — `theme_type_variation` on 51 nodes
- 6 of 7 `godot/scripts/ui/*.gd` — palette constants, `modulate` → `font_color` override
- `server/static/mobile.html` — generated palette block; 17 literals mapped; three button
  rules re-pitched (a light `--negative` cannot be a fill under white text)

### Still open, and deliberately not decided here

- **Item 17 question 2 is still the owner's** — whether the BACKGROUND field is strewn with
  the mystery's title or something else. Nothing this session wires the field to a client, so
  nothing prejudges it. The preview exists so the question can be answered by looking.
- **`config/icon="res://assets/ui/icon.png"` points at a file that does not exist**, and
  `godot/assets/` does not exist either. Not fixed: choosing the window icon means answering
  item 17's open brand question about which mark goes on which device, which is the owner's.
- **Fonts are untouched.** The theme sets sizes and colours; the face is still Godot's
  default. OFL-only per the owner, and it needs a real face committed to the repo.

### The icon sets (owner-supplied, second half of the session)

Owner is supplying two sets — four magnifiers for clues, four speech bubbles for witnesses — with
three instructions: separate them, recolour them to the aesthetic, and **use them at random so
they impart no information.**

`icons/clue/` and `icons/witness/` are the drop points; filenames carry no meaning, the folder
assigns the set. It sits beside `brand/` rather than inside a client for the reason
`brand/README.md` already gives.

`scripts/build_icons.py` flattens every gradient, fill and stroke to one value — the sources are
eight separate hues and the game rations a single accent. Godot copies flatten to **white** so
`modulate` can tint them (Godot's SVG importer has no `currentColor` and recolours by multiplying
a texture); phone copies use `currentColor`. `fill:none` is never painted, since painting it turns
an outline icon into its own silhouette. Paint is rewritten on attributes, in CSS classes and in
inline styles, because exports use all three — an attributes-only pass would leave an
Illustrator file fully coloured **while reporting success**. An embedded raster is refused, not
passed through: it is the exact shape `brand/`'s first two logos had.

**The picking rule is where the work was, and the test caught it being wrong.** `Icons.gd` seeds on
`(game id, key)` so the choice is stable while you look at it and reshuffled between games —
`randi()` re-rolls on every redraw, and `hash(key)` alone is a fixed mapping in disguise. Both were
handled, and the first version was *still* broken:

`String.hash()` is djb2, so keys differing only in a trailing digit produce hashes differing by
about that digit, and a modulus reads the barely-mixed low bits. `clue_0`…`clue_15` drew
**1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 2 3 0 1 2 3** — the icons would have cycled through the set *in order* down
every list. The most legible pattern the set could have had, arrived at by accident, and precisely
what the owner's instruction forbids.

The salt hid the same flaw. A different game shifted every key by one constant offset, so 400 of
400 keys changed icon and the assignment merely **rotated** — which reads as a pass until you
notice they all moved together.

Fixed with the murmur3 32-bit finalizer. `scripts/test_icons.py` asserts the rule as a
*distribution* — uniformity, de-correlation across games, no ordered walk through consecutive ids —
which is why the defect was visible at all. Worth noting the before/after: the broken version
scored **0.0% deviation from a perfectly even share**, because a perfect cycle is perfectly
uniform. Uniformity alone would have certified the bug.

`IconSet.gd` generates empty until artwork lands, deliberately: `Icons.gd` names it, and a
GDScript referencing a missing class fails to **parse** — the defect class that cost Session 36 a
whole screen with no runtime error.

### How the artwork actually arrived, in three rounds

Worth recording, because the pipeline's guards were what made each round cheap.

1. **Two SVGs that were PNGs.** One `<image>` with a base64 payload, zero
   `<path>` elements — the exact shape `brand/negative_logo.svg` had.
   `build_icons.py` refused them, which is what it is for.
2. **Two PNG sheets.** Genuine rasters, four icons to a row. Rather than work
   around it, raster became a supported source: `build_icons.py` flattens a
   `.png` from its alpha channel, which is *simpler* than flattening vector
   because the alpha already is the drawing. One generated white file serves
   both clients — Godot tints with `modulate`, CSS with `mask-image`.
3. **Two real vector sheets.** 10 and 6 `<path>` elements, absolute `CMZ`
   commands, no groups or transforms. These are what shipped.

**The vector split had to happen at SUBPATH level, and the first attempt got it
wrong.** The export grouped by shape rather than by drawing: one element carries
180 subpaths spanning x=374..1202, i.e. pieces of three different icons.
Grouping whole elements put all four icons in one file. Splitting the 607 and
103 subpaths and assigning each to a column by its centre gives 4 and 4, at
x-ranges matching the raster gutters exactly — which is the cross-check that the
two independent methods agree.

Each output keeps its source element's attributes verbatim and only its own
subpaths, so paint, fill-rule and winding survive. Nothing is re-fitted or
re-encoded.

**One blemish, reported not removed.** `witness_03` carries a free-floating mark
three rows tall holding 0.18% of its ink, above the speech bubble — a stray
point in the source art. The splitter now detects that class of thing and says
so. It does not delete it, because that same icon has four legitimately detached
components (the radiating emphasis lines) and anything removing disconnected ink
automatically would eat them.

### Typeface selection

Answered as a specimen page rather than a list: five OFL pairings (display / body / numeral) set
in the palette, at the host screen's own sizes, on real CYM text including *Schatten am Checkpoint*
for diacritic coverage and a room code for numeral disambiguation. Recommendation recorded there:
Archivo Narrow + Source Serif 4, with JetBrains Mono for the room code, on the grounds that the
code is read off a television and typed into a phone by somebody standing up — the one role where
a measurable property beats a preference. Nothing committed to the repo; the choice is the
owner's.

### The typeface, chosen: Nunito Sans

Owner picked it off Google Fonts and asked whether the licence was right. It is —
`METADATA.pb` records `license: "OFL"`, and the bundled `OFL.txt` is SIL Open Font
License 1.1. Checked at source rather than from memory.

Upstream ships it **variable** (four axes: YTLC, opsz, wdth, wght). Three static
instances are committed instead — 400/600/700, verified distinct (`fvar=no`,
`usWeightClass` 400/600/700, 1052 glyphs each). Godot supports variable fonts, but
each weight then needs its own resource carrying a `variation_opentype` dictionary,
so "one file" becomes three resources plus three axis maps, which is more to get
wrong than three files for identical output.

**One family across the whole hierarchy, which removes a class of bug rather than
just simplifying.** A display/body pairing needs the body face listed as the display
face's fallback, because a display face usually has thinner coverage and a missing
glyph renders as a box — first noticed, typically, on a localised title in front of a
playtester. With one family there is no fallback chain. It matters concretely: these
instances carry the Latin-1 accents, so *Schatten am Checkpoint* renders, verified.

Weight now carries hierarchy alongside colour and size: Bold for display and titles,
SemiBold for section headings and the two consequential buttons, Regular for the rest
of the screen. `mobile.html` self-hosts the same release as WOFF2 (a fifth the size
over the air) with the system stack still behind it, so a font that fails to load
costs the look and not the game.

**One thing to watch at the F5:** the room code. Nunito Sans's zero is unslashed, and
the code is read off a television and typed into a phone by somebody standing up. If
`0` against `O` causes trouble in play, the fix is a mono face for that one label
rather than a different UI font.

### The stray mark in witness_03, fixed

Removed at source — a 15.3 × 1.6 sliver sitting at y=0.1, clear of a drawing that
starts at y=18.9. Taken out of `icons/_sheets/fixed_witness_icons.svg` rather than out
of the split file, so re-running the splitter cannot reintroduce it. The icon went
from 30 subpaths across 4 elements to 29 across 3, and the splitter's detached-mark
note no longer fires.

### Next step

Item 23 — build APF — is unchanged and still the stage-1 priority. Before that, an F5 to
confirm the theme renders, since that is the one thing no checker here can establish.

---

## Session 36 — August 26, 2026 (CYM: the first Godot F5 ran; two defects no checker could see)

**Starting point:** `claude/godot-f5-explanation-5ocyy4`, off `main` at `2327e26` (PR #31 merged).

**Item 22 is done.** The Godot client has now been run in the engine, by the owner, on their own
machine. It launched, the main menu came up with the backend connected, and a saved mystery loaded
from the browse list into `CaseDisplay`. The owner's verdict: *"it ran, it's ugly, but it works.
And that's quite good."*

Everything Sessions 34 and 35 wrote for the client had been verified by `check_godot_wiring.py`
and nothing else. That F5 found **two defects in the first twenty minutes**, and the checker had
passed both files.

### Defect 1 — a Variant inference parse error (`e461ef5`)

`case_display.gd:140` failed to compile:

```
Parser Error: The variable type is being inferred from a Variant value, so it
will be typed as Variant. (Warning treated as error.)
```

```gdscript
var relevance_icon := {"critical": "★", "red_herring": "✗", "supporting": "·"}.get(ev.relevance, "·")
```

`Dictionary.get()` returns `Variant`, so `:=` infers `Variant`, and the engine treats that
inference as an error. Fixed by stating the type: `var relevance_icon: String = …`.

**Fatal at parse time, so `CaseDisplay.tscn` never loaded at all** — the case screen did not
render badly, it did not exist. Swept the client afterwards: 66 inferred declarations, and this
was the only one taking its type from a Variant.

### Defect 2 — `##` in a `.tscn` silently dropped five panels (`7cbacd1`)

Clicking **Interrogate Suspects** died on `Cannot call method 'add_item' on a null value` at
`interrogation.gd:62`. The error line was the symptom. The diagnosis was in the running scene's
remote inspector: **twelve `@onready` node references were `<empty>` at runtime**, while
`PhaseLabel`, `BudgetLabel`, `Spinner`, `AccuseButton` and `BackButton` resolved fine.

`Interrogation.tscn` used `##` section headers:

```
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Witness sub-panel
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------
[node name="WitnessPanel" type="VBoxContainer" parent="VBox"]
```

**TSCN comments with `;`. A `#` line is garbage to the scene parser, and the node declared
immediately after one is dropped when the scene loads.** The node is in the file; it never reaches
the tree.

The pattern matched with no exceptions. `WitnessPanel`, `InvestigationPanel`, `LeadPanel`,
`SharedPanel` and `StatusLabel` each sat directly under a `##` block — all five null, and their
children went with them, since a child cannot attach to a parent that is not there. The five nodes
that survived are exactly the ones with no `##` above them.

Removed the 15 offending lines; all 21 nodes still declared. Swept the other seven scenes — none
had any.

### The finding that outlives both bugs: the checker produced a confident false pass

`check_godot_wiring.py` **passed `Interrogation.tscn`** while five of its panels were missing at
runtime. It reads `[node name=…]` lines with a regex, so it saw all 21 nodes and cheerfully
confirmed that every `$NodePath` resolves.

**Reading a scene is not the same as loading it.** That is the whole gap, and it is worth holding
onto, because CLAUDE.md leans on this script to call things verified. Both defects this session
lived precisely where the checker's model of the project diverged from the engine's: one in the
type system, one in the file format.

The checker now flags `#` lines in any `.tscn`. Verified in both directions — the clean tree
passes, and reintroducing a single `##` line fails with exit 1. The narrow check was deliberate:
a full TSCN validator would produce false positives on multi-line property values, whereas `#` is
never valid and catches exactly this class.

### What is verified, and what still is not

Verified by a human at the engine, this session:

| | |
|---|---|
| Project imports, three autoloads register | ✓ |
| F5 launches, main menu renders, backend health check goes green | ✓ |
| `GET /mysteries` browse popup lists 17 saved mysteries | ✓ |
| Selecting a row loads `CaseDisplay` and it renders | ✓ |
| Interrogation screen | fixed after the F5, **not yet re-run** |

Still unverified, and still the remainder of the 17-step F5 checklist written this session
(steps 10–17, published as an artifact, not yet committed to the repo): the accusation
dropdown, the result screen (`9c6c65d`, the whole end-of-game screen), the Smurf substring-matching
regression (`f96a8ab`), rating persistence, and both paid steps — one interrogation call and one
generation.

### Friction worth not repeating

Roughly half the session went on environment, not code. Recorded so the next person skips it:

- **The project manager's `Run` button fails on a fresh clone** — *"Can't run project: Assets need
  to be imported first."* `.godot/` is a generated import cache and is never committed, so the
  first open must be `Edit`. Now step 4 of the checklist.
- **`git checkout -- <path>` is cwd-relative.** Run from `server/` it reported *"did not match any
  file(s) known to git"* for a path that plainly exists. `:/`-anchored paths avoid it.
- **A failed `git checkout <branch>` aborts**, leaving you on the old branch — so a `git log` run
  afterwards shows the wrong history and looks like the fix never landed.
- **The uvicorn server runs in the foreground** and dies with its terminal. It needs its own
  window, left alone. It also needs **no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** for the whole saved-mystery route,
  since `get_client()` is lazy — confirmed by running the server with the variable unset and
  serving `/health` and `/mysteries` from it.
- **Godot 4.7.2 against a project declaring 4.6** opens fine but re-saves `project.godot` and
  `MainMenu.tscn`, which then show as modified in `git status`. Expected, not damage.

That checklist carries all of this as a 17-step procedure, free steps first, with the exact expected values for *Whiteout at Shackleton Base* (4 suspects, culprit
Dr. Marcus Hale) and the Smurf regression (Smurfwick and Smurfadel both correct, Smurfodex wrong).

### Files changed

- `godot/scripts/ui/case_display.gd` — explicit `String` type on `relevance_icon`
- `godot/scenes/ui/Interrogation.tscn` — 15 invalid `##` comment lines removed
- `scripts/check_godot_wiring.py` — new `check_scene_comments()`; `#` in a `.tscn` is now a failure

### Commits

```
7cbacd1 Godot: '##' lines in Interrogation.tscn silently dropped five panels
e461ef5 Godot: fix Variant inference parse error in case_display.gd
```

### Next step

Re-run the interrogation screen to confirm defect 2 is closed, then finish checklist steps 10–17
(and consider committing that checklist as `docs/F5_CHECKLIST.md` — it lives only in an artifact
today). After that, item 23 — build APF.

---

## Session 35 — August 25, 2026 (CYM: the corpus upgrade ran; the investigation model was redesigned to APF; four checkers gained a fifth)

**Starting point:** `claude/session-34-bugs-fixes-uu2hk2`, at `f2bf505` (= `origin/main`, PR #22
merged). Nothing carried over; a clean branch.

The session opened with the owner running the item-19 corpus upgrade and asking, mid-run,
whether to stop it. The run was printing this once per source, for source after source:

```
WARNING  <source> (P1): API error: Error code: 400 - ... 'Your credit balance is too low
         to access the Anthropic API.' — retrying
WARNING  <source> (P1): ... — giving up
ERROR    <source>: ... — skipping, not saving a placeholder (re-run will retry)
=== Done ===  Processed : 0   Failed : 1
```

### What was actually happening

Nothing was damaged. Three things about the *failing* calls, each checked against the code
rather than inferred from the log:

- **No spend.** These are HTTP 400 `invalid_request_error` — rejected before inference.
- **No writes.** The failure lands on Session 23's `ExtractionAPIError` path, which deliberately
  saves no null placeholder, so dedup-by-filename lets a later run retry the source.
- **Confirmed after the fact**: `test_registry_staleness.py` shows an unchanged corpus reusing
  its cache, which is direct evidence the failed run left no fingerprint behind.

So the honest answer was "stop it, but relax." What was worth fixing is that it *needed* stopping
by hand.

**Correction, made later in the session when the owner ran the check.** "Nothing was spent" was
right about the failing calls and wrong about the run. `upgrade_p1_to_p1p2.py` sorts its queue by
extraction count descending, so the 63-story Hitchcock 1980 anthology went first — and **7 stories
upgraded successfully before the balance ran out**, each with a current file in `extractions/` and
its original archived in `_superseded/`. That is real, paid-for work, and it was sitting
uncommitted. The zero-spend claim came from reading only the tail of the log, which was all
novels, all failing on P1. The troubleshooting doc now gives the two-list pattern for telling a
completed upgrade from a half-finished one rather than asserting which happened.

It also sharpens what the fix is worth: the failure landed on story 8 of 63, and
`extract_pdf_anthology` has its own per-story `except ExtractionAPIError: continue`. Unfixed, that
run would have failed 56 more stories one at a time and *then* walked every novel in the queue.

### The bug: nothing anywhere could tell "this source failed" from "the account is dead"

Three defects, in ascending order of how much they cost:

1. **The retry was unconditional.** `_call_claude_for_protocol` retried every API exception once.
   A credit-balance rejection cannot succeed on a retry, so every source paid two round-trips to
   learn the same thing.
2. **The batch loop in `main()` had no way to stop**, only to skip to the next PDF.
3. **And the loop in `main()` was not even the one running.** `upgrade_p1_to_p1p2.py` invokes
   `extract_from_pdfs.py` **once per source as a subprocess** — which is why the log shows
   `Found 1 PDF(s)` and a fresh `=== Done ===` per book. The parent decides from the child's exit
   code alone, and its handler read `if rc != 0: continuing with the next source`. So the parent
   re-opened and re-parsed every remaining PDF, 24,000 characters each, to reprint an identical
   billing error.

**A fourth, found while fixing the third:** `extract_from_pdfs.py` exited **0 no matter how many
sources failed**. So the wrapper's `if rc != 0` never fired, its `failures` tally could never
increment, and `Done. N source(s) exited non-zero` was unreachable code. The wrapper returned
success after a run in which every single source failed.

### The fix

`_fatal_reason(exc)` classifies an error as account-level or not, and `FatalAPIError` carries it.

The classification **cannot key off the HTTP status alone**, and that is the design point. A 400
covers both an exhausted credit balance (fatal — every later call fails identically) and a single
source whose text overruns a limit (not fatal — skip it, continue). Anthropic returns both as
`400 invalid_request_error`. So the credit case is matched on message, 401/403/404 on status, and
every other 400 stays retryable.

`FatalAPIError` is deliberately **not** a subclass of `ExtractionAPIError` — the per-source
handlers catch that and `continue`, which is right for a network blip and exactly wrong here, so
it needs to propagate past them untouched.

Exit codes are now `EXIT_SOURCE_FAILED = 1` / `EXIT_FATAL = 2`, and the wrapper stops on 2.
The constant is duplicated in the wrapper rather than imported (importing would make merely
*planning* an upgrade require anthropic/pypdf/dotenv); a test asserts the two never drift.

### Verification — `scripts/test_extraction_fatal_errors.py` (new, zero API cost)

19 assertions, no network, no SDK (stubbed). Beyond the classifier table, three that carry weight:

- **The distinction under test**, with the two 400s side by side: the real credit-balance message
  must stop the batch, `prompt is too long: 210000 tokens > 200000 maximum` must not.
- **The anthology path**, which is the one that actually ran: a stub that succeeds twice and then
  dies fatally must stop at story 3 **and keep the two stories already extracted**.
- **End-to-end on the real script**, run as a subprocess against a stubbed SDK on `PYTHONPATH`,
  asserting the exit code the shell actually gets — 2 for credit exhaustion, 1 for a dropped
  connection. Every other check could pass while the process still exited 0 and the wrapper still
  marched through the corpus.
- **The drift check was itself verified by breaking it** — the wrapper's constant was changed to 3
  and the test confirmed failing before being restored.

`test_registry_staleness.py`, `test_crime_scene_map.py` (193), `check_godot_wiring.py`,
`check_mystery_playable.py` (19 mysteries, 0 unwinnable) all still pass.

### Also worth knowing

`docs/EXTRACTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` gains the credit-balance entry and one new section: **the
protocols loop inside a single `try`**, so a source that completes P1 and P2 and then fails on P3
is discarded whole — real spend, no file. It is the one way this run can cost money and leave
nothing behind. It did *not* happen here (every source died on P1), but the doc now says how to
check for it after any mid-batch stop.

### The upgrade landed, and the registry could not see it

The owner's working tree held **7 anthology stories already upgraded** — each with a modified
extraction and its original archived, the completed-upgrade signature. Verified real, not
truncated: `P1+P2+P3` on all seven, ~6 parts → ~20 each.

Checking whether the registry had noticed turned up a live bug:

```
checked-in registry : 4967 parts
load_registry()     : 4967 parts   ← reports itself fresh
force=True rebuild  : 5065 parts   ← the truth
```

**98 parts, paid for and unsampled**, with the staleness check saying everything was fine.

Session 33's fingerprint hashed the *set of extraction filenames*. It documented its own blind
spot in the docstring — *"an extraction file EDITED IN PLACE, keeping its name, is not detected.
Pass force=True"* — and that blind spot is exactly the shape of the P1→P1P2P3 upgrade, which
rewrites a source under its own name. So the check could not see the single largest corpus
operation the project has planned, and would have missed all 66 remaining sources too.

**Fixed by hashing contents as well as names.** Clone-stable (unlike mtime, rejected for good
reason in Session 33) and ~11 ms across 571 files / 2.7 MB — there was never a reason to
approximate it. `load_registry()` self-corrected to 5,065 on the next call; the regenerated
registry is committed.

The general lesson is the one Session 33 already drew and this proves again: **a written warning
is not a control.** The docstring told a future reader to pass `force=True` after editing in
place, and the very next in-place edit lost 98 parts anyway.

`test_registry_staleness.py` gains the case, using the real P3 field (`setting_as_constraint`)
rather than an arbitrary one, so it mimics an actual upgrade. Verified by reverting the
fingerprint to filename-only and confirming the new assertions fail.

### The upgrade ran: 67 of 67, and what it actually bought

The owner topped up API credits (the first $50 had gone to Claude Code's wallet — a different
website, a different balance, and the error message names the right one) and ran it. **63
anthology stories + 11 novels, zero failures.** The fail-fast machinery never had to fire.

Measured against the archived originals: **5.5 → 19.4 parts per source, 3.5x, across 70 sources.**

**The finding worth keeping is about source type, and part counts actively hide it.** Both
anthologies and novels land at ~19.5 parts of a possible ~20 mapped keys — saturated. By that
metric novels look *better* (4.2x vs 3.5x), which is purely an artifact of a lower starting
point. Confidence tells the real story:

| | high | medium | low | null |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| anthology story | **81%** | 16% | 0% | 3% |
| novel | **48%** | 44% | 4% | 4% |

A short story under 25,000 chars is fed whole; a novel is capped at 24,000 chars — ~7% of the
book in three disconnected chunks. P3 describes whole-book structure, which is exactly what
sampling destroys. So `CLAUDE.md` item 7's anthology-first guideline now has a measured quality
justification alongside its original cost-per-clearance one, and it is the stronger of the two.
Owner confirmed legal is comfortable proceeding on that basis.

Fix for novels when there's appetite: raise `--max-text-chars`. The 24,000 cap is arbitrary
against a 1M context — ~$15 buys all 12 novels the quality the stories have. Not urgent; it buys
corpus quality, not anything a playtester sees.

**A prediction that was made before the data and held:** novels would show weaker P3 than
stories. It was recorded as testable, tested, and it was the *metric* that had to be corrected,
not the claim.

### A Ctrl-C should not traceback

Interrupting the run tracebacked out of `subprocess.call` in the wrapper — which prints "Safe to
interrupt" at the top of every run. The child's handler was added earlier this session and the
parent's was skipped on scope grounds; that was wrong, since the parent is where the user's
Ctrl-C lands. Both ends now exit 130 and say how to resume, and the child no longer reuses the
fatal-error copy ("re-run after the cause is fixed" reads oddly when the cause was a deliberate
keypress). Nothing was ever at risk — the in-flight source writes no placeholder.

### The investigation model — a UX question that found three live defects

The session's second half was design, not code: the owner asked how CLOUD's top-down crime scene
would actually work. **Full record in `docs/INVESTIGATION_DESIGN.md`** — this is the summary.

Asking "would a Black Forest mystery work?" turned out to be the right question. Three answers,
in ascending order of how much they matter:

**The floor plan is the wrong picture, and only the renderer thinks otherwise.** Generation is
already setting-agnostic (`investigation_areas`, "plausible for the setting" — the word "room"
appears nowhere) and the coherence engine has no spatial rule at all. But
`crime_scene_map._row_rects` packs rectangles into a building; a Black Forest renders as a
forty-metre ravine in a 308×289 box, fourteen pixels from a hut. The owner's Dick Francis case
settles it — racetrack, stables, country estate, lawyer's office are miles apart, and *proximity
is not the constraint, access is*. A connection map replaces it.

**Witness placement is fabricated.** `area = placed[i % len(placed)]` — witnesses are dealt into
areas round-robin by list position. Nothing in the mystery says where anyone is, so a witness who
says "I was in the kitchen all evening" can be drawn in the ravine. Evidence and leads have no
location field at all. Of four content types, exactly one is genuinely located.

**The investigation phase can deadlock** — logged as item 21, stage-1 blocking. Sharing is the
only phase exit, you cannot share nothing, and all 5 areas can be blocked before the last player
acts. Every difficulty at every player count wants more investigations than there are areas. Root
cause is the phase gate, not the block pool.

### Two owner ideas that changed the shape

**The narrative hands out the options, and the pool grows.** Round 1's options are stated in prose
by the opening narration; round 2 is what nobody took plus what round 1 unlocked. This kills blind
exploration — which the owner objected to as neither fun nor social, and which turns out to be
*structurally* the deadlock — and it makes the deadlock impossible rather than patched. It also
works as a **plain list before it needs any map**, which is the stage-1 build.

**Not every action needs to be vital.** Red herrings and innocent bystanders are the point, so the
fix is never "add just enough content." That reframed the deadlock correctly: the exit condition
should be *"you are done acting,"* not *"you found something."* Today the code cannot tell "found
nothing useful" from "found nothing at all," and only one of those should stop a game.

### Solvability as arithmetic — the piece worth keeping

Owner's question: *"how do we ensure the clues are actual clues that come together for the
solution?"*

`relevance: "critical"` is a **label, not a relationship** — nothing says E3 rules out Tanaka, and
the claim that five items prove Hale did it lives only in prose. Meanwhile
`P1.C5.dangling_key_evidence`, the rule meant to guarantee solvability, carries the message
*"Resolution refers to evidence players can never find"* while checking only that the ID exists in
the array. **The same failure family as Session 34's culprit bug: a rule whose message states the
real requirement and whose check is a weaker proxy.**

The fix is to make elimination a field (`exonerates` / `implicates`), after which solvability is a
set operation: remove everyone exonerated by the key evidence; **exactly one suspect must remain,
and it must be the culprit.** Three BLOCKING conditions fall out that nothing detects today — two
survivors, zero survivors, wrong survivor — each producing a game that cannot be won.

Free interim check available with no schema change: `how_to_deduce` already cites evidence IDs and
areas inline (*"the Cold Storage motion log (E3, Area A1)"*), so parsing those and confirming they
cover `key_evidence` catches non-load-bearing key evidence today.

The honest boundary: **structure is provable for free, fairness is empirical (the viability rating
and accusation data), and meaning is the expensive middle you mostly do not need to buy.**

### APF — the owner simplified the game, and it deleted the deadlock

Late in the session the owner cut exploration entirely. **"All Provided For": findings are dealt,
not gathered; the only decision is which to share and which to keep.** Reasoning, in their order:
moving and searching is not the fun part; free-text interrogation invites griefing (*"watch me
tell this witness to eat a donut"* — and `InterrogateRequest.question` is a `str` today, so that
is live); and it concentrates the game on what `CLAUDE.md`'s own first paragraph calls the core
innovation.

**The deadlock (item 21) is not fixed by this — it stops existing.** Nothing to block, everyone
holds findings by construction, no phase to be trapped in. The block pool, phase gates, traversal
and investigation budget all go with it, and play-time API cost drops to roughly zero — which is
the lever `docs/AI_COST_PLAYBOOK.md` already identified as the right one, pushed all the way.

The dealing constraints are the new correctness surface, and they are **free**: generate findings
with elimination data (one call), then deal under constraints as pure computation — a failed deal
is re-dealt at zero cost. Union must eliminate all but one suspect; no single hand may do so; it
must become solvable at the minimum share threshold.

**Path 2 (one pick-list interrogation) is a flag, not a fork.** If the list is over pre-generated
questions the answers already exist, so it is only *"one of your findings arrives chosen instead
of dealt"* — same generation, deal, share and reveal. Ship APF with a toggle and one group tests
both in an evening. Consequence: solvability must hold across all pick combinations, which for
4 players × 3 options is 81 exhaustive set checks at zero cost. Explicitly *not* the shortcut of
making all options eliminate the same thing — that is cosmetic choice and players feel it.

### Two corrections the owner prompted

**Top-down was over-rejected.** §1 of the design doc had generalised the defect from
"packs rectangles" to "top-down". Wrong: `_row_rects` fills rows because it reasons about *"the
shape of the building"* — it draws interior architecture, and that is what breaks on a forest.
**Scale absorbs the Dick Francis case** (floor plan → site plan → terrain → regional, one renderer,
different zoom), and it also removes the objection this document itself raised against a node
graph, that it *"looks like a diagram, not a place."* In APF the map is presentation, not
mechanic, so it cannot deadlock or lie about movement. The code change is small — of seven
functions only `_grid_shape` and `_row_rects` are offenders, and most of the 193 assertions test
invariants a scattered layout must satisfy anyway.

**The video placeholder does not exist.** `CLAUDE.md` item 15 claimed the client renders a static
`"Video Scene Will Play Here"`. That string is in no `.gd`, `.tscn`, `.html` or `.py` file. Fourth
doc-says-built / code-says-no gap this session, after the result screen, the saved-mystery
dropdown and `_slug`.

**But something better does exist, unused.** `_generate_cinematic_brief()` (`server/main.py:335`)
returns a player-facing `opening_narration` — its own spec reads *"3–5 sentences of atmospheric
prose, written to be displayed or read aloud to players"* — alongside a hidden `cinematic_brief`
shot list for the eventual video. Gated behind `cinematic_brief: bool = False`, never run. That is
exactly the text-heavy opening the owner asked for, one boolean away, for one call at generation
time.

Measured beats for the paced reveal: narration (3–5 sentences), `initial_discovery` (224 chars),
`when` (86), `what_happened` (421), `setting.description` (531) — ~1,300 characters over five
beats of deliberately varied length. Pacing is free (client-side timing) and on a shared screen it
is a group moment rather than homework.

Recorded against the video slot: **do not ship a grey "Video Scene Will Play Here" box** — it
announces unfinished software exactly when immersion matters. The slot should hold the crime
depicted as well as it currently can, with the narration timed over it.

### Closing the doc-vs-code gap

Four times this session a document said a thing was built and the code disagreed: the result
screen's node paths, the saved-mystery dropdown's signals, `_slug`, and a video panel that exists
in no client file. Three were found by reading code for unrelated reasons. That is not a process.

**The gate question was whether these docs are checkable at all. Measured, they are:** 213
file-path claims across `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/`, of which 6 did not resolve — and 5 of those were
legitimate (a historical rename, a generated-on-demand file, a designed-not-built artifact, a
fill-in-the-blank placeholder). A 97% resolve rate says the docs cite code precisely enough to
verify mechanically.

`scripts/check_doc_claims.py` checks three kinds of claim: a referenced file exists, a
*path:line* reference is inside the file, and a backtick-quoted string is actually in a code file.
It deliberately skips `SESSIONS.md` — a historical record whose claims were true when written and
must not be re-verified against today — and skips prose and numbers, which are not
machine-settleable and would make it cry wolf.

**It found four stale claims in `docs/WIRING.md` on its first working run**, one of them the
*same* video-panel sentence corrected in `CLAUDE.md` an hour earlier. Nobody re-reads every doc
after fixing one; a grep does. The other three document Streamlit spinner labels that now exist
only in `deprecated/`.

**Three false passes before it worked, each a different self-reference**, and they are worth
recording because "does this string exist" has more corners than it looks:

1. searching the whole repo — the doc's own sentence was the evidence;
2. searching all markdown — `CLAUDE.md` and `SESSIONS.md` *writing up the correction* became
   evidence the thing existed;
3. searching code including the checker — whose comment quoted the example string.

It also caught its own author: the CLAUDE.md paragraph introducing it used a backtick-quoted fake
path as an illustration, and was flagged.

**The convention this establishes:** backtick-quoting a string in `CLAUDE.md` or `docs/` is a
*claim* that the product contains it. To mention one without asserting it — a retired label, an
illustrative pattern — use italics or the script's `ALLOWED_LITERALS`, which costs a sentence
saying why.

Also switched from shelling out to `grep` to a pure-Python walk: `--include`/`--exclude` did not
filter as expected here, and a search that silently matches more than it should is precisely the
failure this script exists to prevent.

### Next steps

1. **[STAGE 1, BLOCKING] The Godot F5.** Nothing from Session 34 or 35 has run in the engine —
   the result screen, the accusation matching, the saved-mystery dropdown and every wiring fix are
   verified by static checker only. No Godot binary exists in the remote environment, so this
   needs the owner's machine. It is the only thing standing between the current state and a
   playtest, and it costs nothing.
2. **[STAGE 1] Build APF.** `docs/PLAYTEST_FLOW.md` → "APF" is the agreed shape. The build order
   in `docs/INVESTIGATION_DESIGN.md` §7 still applies, reduced by APF:
   - `exonerates` / `implicates` on evidence, plus the set-arithmetic solvability check
   - the constrained deal (pure computation, re-dealable at zero cost)
   - the share decision, the suspect board, the reveal
   - `cinematic_brief: bool = True` for the paced text opening
   The deadlock fix drops off the list — APF deletes the mechanic that had it.
3. **[OPEN, owner] Five design questions**, listed in `docs/INVESTIGATION_DESIGN.md` §6: what a
   connection line means, affordance display, player-position visibility, the budget model, and
   titles that name the culprit.
4. **[OPEN] Item 18** — should generation refuse to save a BLOCKING mystery, retry it, or serve it
   with a louder warning? Untouched, and worth settling before the funding stage: "the coherence
   engine detects the defect and ships it anyway" is a question someone will ask.
5. **[NOT URGENT] The novel re-run**, ~$15 to raise `--max-text-chars` and close the 33-point P3
   confidence gap between novels and anthology stories. Buys corpus quality, not anything a
   playtester sees.
6. **[NOT URGENT] `salvation-of-a-saint`** extracted only 14,690 characters total — under the
   sampling cap, so that PDF is likely a preview or has a broken text layer rather than being the
   novel.

### What this session did not do

No Godot code ran. No client work was built. The APF design is recorded, not implemented. The
corpus is upgraded and the tooling around it is now hard to misuse, but **the playtest is still
one F5 and one client build away**, and that has been true since Session 34.

---

## Session 34 — August 21, 2026 (CYM: PC-playtest priority set; a wiring check found the result screen broken)

**Branch:** `claude/session-33-summary-6m0y5u`, at `034131f` — checked against `origin/main`
rather than assumed, per this file's standing branch-hygiene warning. It *is* `main`'s tip, zero
unmerged commits, clean tree. No stale-branch problem this time.

Short session, owner-directed, two of item 17's blockers cleared.

### Moderation: none yet, and the disclaimer is the point

Owner's call on item 17's first open question: **no moderation** — no wordlist, no
`moderateHeckle()`-style Claude pass. The room is people who chose to play together and can see
who typed it.

What ships with that decision is the owner's own addition and it is the interesting half: a line
of text under the prompt entry box reading **"Not moderated for play testing"**. Owner's framing —
*"this will not only give us some cover, but act as a reminder going forward."* That second job is
the real one. The failure mode for "no moderation yet" is not that it is wrong today; it is that
it is invisible, so it stops being a decision and becomes the status quo by default. A disclaimer
sitting under the box every time anyone types a prompt cannot be forgotten the way a line in a
markdown file can.

It is explicitly **not** the Steam answer. A user-typed string rendered TV-sized for a whole game
still needs a real one before release; item 17's risk entry says so in the same place.

`godot/scenes/ui/MysteryGeneration.tscn` → `VBox/ModerationNoticeLabel`, sitting directly under
`PromptInput`, muted grey at 12px so it reads as a footnote rather than as an instruction.

**Where it does *not* appear, and why that is not an oversight:** `server/static/mobile.html` has
**no prompt entry box at all**. Session 26 built the room-first flow — players suggest prompts
while waiting, `POST /games/{id}/prompts` — entirely server-side; the phone client's lobby section
still only lists players. When that box gets built, the same line goes under it.

### The reusable-mystery dropdown: in the build, and inert since it was written

Owner asked whether it was still in the build. Yes — and it had never worked.

`MainMenu` → "Browse Saved Mysteries" → `GET /mysteries` → a popup `ItemList` labelled by each
mystery's `title`. The endpoint is real and returns title, difficulty, coherence result and
viability rating. `main_menu.gd` has a complete `_on_browse_item_selected` handler that loads the
chosen slug and hands it to `CaseDisplay`.

**None of the popup's signals were connected.** `_ready()` wired the four menu buttons and
stopped; `MainMenu.tscn` has zero `[connection]` sections. So `_on_browse_item_selected` was dead
code, clicking a row did nothing, and the popup could not be dismissed either — a Godot `Window`
does not hide itself on `close_requested`, the handler has to. The list rendered correctly, which
is presumably why it read as finished.

Fixed: `item_selected`, the Close button, and `close_requested` are now wired.

**Two things it still is not**, both flagged rather than built, because both are design calls:
- **Single-player only.** A selected mystery goes straight to `CaseDisplay.tscn`. The server has
  supported multiplayer reuse since Session 26 — `CreateGameRequest.mystery_slug` is documented
  "skip prompt-collection, attach an already-generated mystery immediately" — but no UI reaches
  it, so a group cannot replay a saved case together. Given the owner said *reusable*, this is
  very likely what was actually meant, and it is the obvious next step.
- **Absent from the phone client.** `mobile.html` has no mystery list.

### Item 17's second question is half-answered

Owner: *"Title is just for generation, but should also be used in a drop down menu of reusable
mysteries."* So the title **feeds generation** rather than only decorating, and it is the handle
the saved list is browsed by — which the dropdown above already does today.

What "just for generation" does *not* settle is whether the BACKGROUND still strews the title, or
something else. Recorded as open in item 17 rather than guessed at, because the whole design rests
on it.

### The priority order, memorialized

Owner set the sequence mid-session: **PC playtest → funding → phone + robust gen-AI calls**, with
*"obviously it can change."* Written into root `CLAUDE.md` as its own **Delivery Priority**
section near the top, above Architecture, because it decides what counts as a blocker rather than
describing a feature.

It immediately settled a question this same session had raised. The saved-mystery browse loading
into single-player `CaseDisplay` instead of `create_game(mystery_slug=…)` had been flagged as "a
real next step"; the owner pointed at the priority order, and they are right — the PC playtest
needs one person at one machine replaying a saved case, which is what the single-player route
already does. Group replay is stage 3. Recorded as deliberate in item 17 so it does not get
re-flagged as an oversight next session.

Same logic retires several other standing "gaps" until stage 3: `mobile.html`'s missing prompt box
and mystery list, Steam-grade moderation, and every remaining API-cost item (the P1P2
re-extraction, the 11 held-back anthologies, the 7 all-null extractions) — all real, none of them
things a playtester would notice.

### Then the actual stage-1 work: a wiring check, and it found a broken final screen

If the PC client is the only surface that has to work, the browse popup's dead signals stop being
a curiosity and start being a pattern worth checking for. **Every scene in this project has zero
`[connection]` blocks** — all wiring is done in `_ready()` by code — which is a consistent
convention and also why a forgotten `.connect()` is invisible: nothing in the scene file records
that a button was ever meant to do anything.

**`scripts/check_godot_wiring.py`** (new, zero API cost, no Godot binary needed) checks four
things across every scene/script pair: every `$NodePath` resolves, every `@onready var x: T`
matches the node's real type, every interactive control is referenced at all (a lint, reported as
NOTE), and every `GameState.` / `ApiClient.` / `NetworkManager.` member exists and is called with
an arity the definition accepts.

**It found a hard failure on its first run, on the last screen of the game.** `result_screen.gd`
dereferenced `$MainVBox/VerdictLabel` and four siblings, but `ResultScreen.tscn` nests all of them
under `ScrollContainer/MainVBox/…`. All five `@onready` lookups missed. That is the screen a
playtester reaches at the end of **every** playthrough — the verdict, the solution, the viability
rating that is Design Principle 1's entire creator feedback loop, and both buttons. Fixed by
correcting the paths.

Worth noting *why* it survived this long: it is invisible everywhere except at runtime. The scene
is well-formed, the script is well-formed, and nothing connects the two until Godot loads the
scene — so reading either file alone shows nothing wrong.

**Two false positives were fixed in the checker rather than tolerated**, since a checker that
cries wolf gets ignored:
- GDScript `enum` declarations are referenced as `GameState.Phase.WITNESS`. The first hand-run
  flagged seven of these as missing members. The enum name is a member; it is now parsed as one.
- `main_menu.gd`'s doc comment says *"calls ApiClient.list_mysteries()"*, which the arity check
  read as a real zero-argument call against a one-argument definition. Comments are now stripped
  (quote-aware) before any analysis.

**The checker was negative-tested three ways**, because the cheap way to make a checker green is
to make it check nothing: a bad node path, a wrong declared type, and a wrong argument count were
each introduced and each caught, then reverted.

### Walking the rest of the screens by hand — four more, and one of them is a pillar failing

The wiring check covers node paths and autoload calls. It cannot see whether one screen writes
what the next screen reads, so the single-player PC path was walked by hand: MainMenu →
MysteryGeneration → CaseDisplay → Interrogation → Accusation → ResultScreen.

**First, the good news, because it was the thing most likely to be broken.** In single-player
every budget is 0 — they are handed out by the server on game create/join, and single-player never
creates a game. `_check_phase_complete()` advances to the multiplayer `ShareSelection` screen the
moment a budget hits 0, which from a standing start would have bounced the player out of the game
immediately. It does not happen: `_on_legacy_reply` (the single-player reply path) deliberately
never calls it. That is correct and was presumably deliberate, but nothing said so, so it is worth
recording as verified rather than re-checked every session.

**The visible half of that was still wrong:** the same zero rendered as *"0 questions remaining"*
on a screen that in fact allows unlimited questions. A playtester reads that as "I am out". Now
reads "Ask as many questions as you like." in single-player.

**`_slug` is assigned after the file is written, so no saved mystery has ever had one.**
`_run_generation_pipeline` calls `_save_mystery(mystery_dict)` and *then* sets
`mystery_dict["_slug"]`, so the slug exists only on the in-memory dict returned to the client.
Confirmed against disk: **0 of 18 saved mysteries contain `_slug`.** Both rating widgets read
`GameState.current_mystery.get("_slug", "")` and skip the request when it is empty, so rating a
mystery loaded from the browse list did nothing — and `result_screen.gd` dims the buttons anyway,
so it looked like it had saved. That is Design Principle 1's creator feedback loop, silently
dead on exactly the path Session 34 had just made clickable. Fixed in `get_mystery()`, which now
derives `_slug` from the filename the same way `/mysteries` already does — one place, and it fixes
the 18 files already on disk rather than only new ones.

**CaseDisplay's rating row destroyed its own label.** `_build_viability_buttons()` freed every
child of `ViabilityRow` and then re-added `viability_label` — but that label *is* a child of
`ViabilityRow` in the scene, so `add_child()` raises "already has a parent", and the `queue_free()`
then deleted it at the end of the frame. Now frees only the buttons it added.

**And the real find: a mystery can be unwinnable, the engine knows, and nothing acts on it.**
`accusation.gd` scored an accusation with `_selected_suspect == culprit`. One saved mystery —
*The Stolen Star of Smurf Village*, from the Smurf prompt that is `submit_prompt`'s own docstring
example — has a two-culprit solution, so `solution.culprit` is prose:
`"Smurfwick the Craftsmurf (primary architect) and Smurfadel, Master of Adornment (accomplice who
physically carried the Star)"`. Under exact equality **every** accusation on that mystery is
wrong, including both correct ones. The game cannot be won.

The part worth sitting with: **`coherence_validator.py` catches this precisely.** It raises
`P1.C4.culprit_not_in_characters`, severity `BLOCKING`, message *"Chain is broken; players can
never identify them."* The mystery recorded `{"passed": false, "blocking": 1}` — and was saved,
served, and displayed anyway, with a red badge on CaseDisplay among a dozen other fields. The
coherence engine is not the thing that failed here; the pipeline's willingness to ignore its
verdict is. That is worth knowing before the pillar is described to anyone in stage 2.

Two fixes, deliberately at different altitudes:
- `accusation.gd` now matches exact-first, then substring, with a guard so a short name cannot
  match inside a longer one ("Smurf" must not score as "Smurfwick the Craftsmurf"). Checked
  against all 16 real mysteries: it rescues the Smurf case to both real culprits and changes
  nothing else. It makes the game winnable without pretending the data is clean.
- The accusation screen now says so on screen when no listed suspect can be the answer, instead
  of letting a generation defect reach the player as their own mistake.
- **Not fixed, and it is a design call:** whether the pipeline should refuse to save or serve a
  mystery whose coherence report is BLOCKING, or regenerate it. That costs API calls and is a real
  decision. Logged as item 18.

**`scripts/check_mystery_playable.py`** (new, zero cost) asks the narrow pre-playtest question:
does `solution.culprit` resolve to a listed suspect under accusation.gd's own rule, are there any
suspects at all, and did coherence record a blocking failure that was served anyway. All 18 saved
mysteries pass as winnable; the Smurf one is flagged with both notes.

### Verification

`python3 scripts/check_godot_wiring.py` → clean across 8 scenes and 3 autoloads, plus the three
negative tests above. `scripts/check_mystery_playable.py` → 18 checked, 0 unwinnable.
`scripts/test_registry_staleness.py` → passes. `server/main.py` parses. The culprit-matching rule
was validated against all 16 real mysteries, including an adversarial short-name case built to
break the guard.

There is no Godot binary in this environment, so **nothing was actually run in the engine.** The
ResultScreen fix is verified against the scene file, not against a running game. **This wants one
F5** to confirm the browse popup clicks through, the results screen renders, and the moderation
notice sits where it should.

### Part 2 — the playtest gameflow, specified and started

Owner specified the seven-screen PC flow; it is written down as **`docs/PLAYTEST_FLOW.md`** and
supersedes the older Phase 2/3 screen descriptions on the playtest path.

**`crime_scene_map.py`** (new, 193 assertions) derives the top-down layout from the mystery.
Claude is never asked for coordinates: they are the one part of the payload a computer produces
for free, every extra schema field is another parse-failure surface, and an LLM asked for
rectangles produces overlapping rectangles. The prompt owns *meaning*; the module owns
presentation, seeded from the title so the host screen and a future phone client draw the
identical map. A mystery with no `investigation_areas` gets **no map**, reported as such rather
than invented rooms — the playtest exists to find out whether generation produces usable areas.

**The blocker, measured:** 0 of 18 saved mysteries had `investigation_areas` or `leads`, though
the prompt has asked for 5 and 4 since Phase 3a. Every saved file predates that change. So the
prompt had **never been verified to produce them**.

### Part 3 — the generation schema, and one real generation

Prompt now asks for exactly 4 suspects, 3–4 witnesses, a true actionable `statement` per witness,
and `discovery` + `analysis` per area — the two halves of *"You searched the AREA and found THIS.
Testing and research reveal ANALYSIS."* These are fixed text, not conversations, so they are
written during the generation call already being paid for.

**Verified with one real generation**, *Whiteout at Shackleton Base*: 4 suspects, 3 witnesses,
5 areas, 4 leads, 8 evidence, culprit exactly a suspect name, coherence passed 0 blocking /
0 warnings. Two API calls (generation + localization).

Two bugs found getting there:
- **`max_tokens` was 8192; the measured response is 8,667.** Generation was being cut off
  mid-JSON. That is what "13 of 14 generations failed on `Unterminated string`" in the old batch
  summary actually was. Now 16000.
- **`get_client()` passed the session ingress token as `api_key=`**, so it went out on x-api-key
  and returned 401. It is a *bearer* token — which is what `CLAUDE.md` always called it. The
  documented fallback auth path could never have worked.

### Part 4 — the economics, measured and twice corrected

**`docs/AI_COST_PLAYBOOK.md`** plus a shareable artifact. Headline: 2,457 input tokens against
8,667 output, so **output is 95% of a generation call** — which kills prompt caching as a lever
(~5%) before anyone spends effort on it.

**Two corrections to my own analysis, both from the owner and both material:**
1. One-call-per-mystery was framed as a saving found by analysis. It is not — it is the intended
   design ("*We never, ever planned for live calls*"), so there is no baseline to have saved
   against. What the analysis actually found is a **divergence**: the shipped server makes live
   play-time calls at six sites (`_investigate_area_with_ai`, `_follow_lead_with_ai`,
   `_generate_witness_scene`, both `/interrogate` endpoints, `_generate_resolution_narrative`).
   Nobody chose a per-action architecture; it accumulated an endpoint at a time. **Single-player
   interrogation hits one of them on every question.** $1.48 vs $0.14 is the size of that gap.
2. The corollary points *away* from cost-cutting: with no play-time calls a mystery's AI cost is
   fixed, one-time, and amortises across replays — so **generation is the right place to spend**,
   and "more expansive" is the cheapest improvement available. Watch the 16,000-token ceiling;
   past it, generation must become a streaming call.

### Part 5 — which model for P1→P2, answered by measurement

**`scripts/compare_extraction_models.py`** scores models against the only consumer that matters:
`part_registry._atomize_extraction`. Prose quality is not the metric; **parts** are.

Seven Hitchcock stories: Haiku 5/7 full extractions (lost the alibi axis twice), Sonnet 6/7 (one
JSON parse failure, billed in full), Opus 7/7. Haiku's losses are not inaccuracy —
`_atomize_extraction` silently skips `confidence: "low"`, and on an inverted story with no literal
alibi Haiku returned empty at low confidence while Sonnet and Opus named the functional
equivalent. Where all three succeed the gap is *mechanism*: Haiku records that an alibi existed,
Opus records how the gap in it was manufactured.

**Two more corrections to my own advice:** "put extraction on Haiku for a 3× cut" was wrong twice
— `extract_from_pdfs.py` has always defaulted to Haiku, and the corpus line is far too small for
a 3× cut to matter. 206 of 281 `pdf_*` extractions are already P1P2; the job is exactly **75
sources**, $1.15–$8.90 depending on model. The whole decision is worth about $7.75, so it is a
quality call, not a cost one.

### Part 6 — making the run possible, and four bugs that would have broken it

**It could not have run at all.** Dedup is by output filename, so `--protocol P1P2` on an
already-extracted source printed SKIP and did nothing. All 75 would have been no-ops. `--upgrade`
re-extracts only when the existing file lacks a requested protocol — idempotent and resumable.
Replaced extractions move to `extractions/_superseded/`, never deleted.

**`scripts/upgrade_p1_to_p1p2.py`** plans and runs the job, defaulting to printing the plan and
spending nothing. It exists because the sources are not one directory, and because 8 of the 12
novel PDFs are no longer on disk — better reported up front than discovered mid-run.
`--find-missing` names them; `--source-dir` searches outside the repo; `--check-sources` opens
every PDF and compares what it yields now against what the original extraction recorded, catching
a scan with no OCR layer before it wastes a call.

**Source matching had to become forgiving**, because a re-acquired book rarely returns under the
recorded name — verified: exact matched, `The_Winter_Queen_-_Boris_Akunin.pdf` and
`Turkish Gambit.pdf` both failed. Loose tiers accept only a *unique* hit. A single-shared-word
tier was written, tested and **removed**: with only "Turkish" in common it matched
*Turkish Delight Mystery* to *Turkish Gambit*. A unique match is not a correct one.

**Novels were being starved.** `MAX_TEXT_CHARS = 6000` — ~1.7% of a 350,000-char book in three
disconnected chunks. Fine for P1; thin for P2/P3, whose fields describe structure only visible
across a whole book. `--max-text-chars` makes it settable (default unchanged); the planner passes
24,000.

### Part 7 — CLOUD assessed, and the decision to run P1P2P3

Owner proposed **CLOUD**: after the inciting-incident video, the interface becomes a manipulable
top-down scene. Two reference images — a photo-real 1920s street, and a schematic floor plan with
E1–E6 evidence callouts. Answered from data:

- **The corpus contains no spatial structure.** Space appears incidentally at 2–14% across 564
  extractions, never as layout, adjacency or sightline.
- **CLOUD's geometry was never going to come from the corpus.** Generation already *knows* the
  spatial facts, as prose: evidence E2 is literally named "Serrated Bolt-Driver (found in
  Generator Room)", and `solution.method` is the culprit's route in sentences. What is missing is
  **fields, not knowledge** — `area_id` on evidence, adjacency between areas, a path.
- **The two images are different kinds of thing.** The schematic is *data rendered* and is nearly
  buildable now. The photo-real image is *presentation*, only an image model makes it, and it is
  stage-3 money. Conflating them is the trap.
- **What transfers is the spatial *device*, not the geometry** — and the taxonomy already has the
  field: **P3.F4 "Setting as Constraint"**. P3 had never been run: 0 of 564.

So the answer was **not** to pause for CLOUD, but to switch this run to **P1P2P3**: P3 costs ~$2
more in the same pass and ~$8 more as a later one. Measured on *The Red House Mystery*, F4
returned *"an office reachable only through a passage of spring-hinged doors, plus a secret
passage… door movements are legible only as shadows on the passage wall"* — adjacency, a hidden
route and a sightline mechanic, as a relation rather than a floor plan, so it ports to a Mars dome.

**`KEY_TO_IDX` extended for 7 of P3's 8 keys** (`evidence_type` deliberately unmapped — axis 8 was
*named* evidence_type until Session 23 renamed it to `alibi`; mapping F5 there would recreate that
mislabeling). `REGISTRY_SCHEMA_VERSION` → 3. Without this, P3 would have produced 8 fields and
**zero parts** — the Session 23 / Session 33 failure a third time.

**Four bugs, all found by running it rather than reading it:**
- `--protocol` rejected `P1P2`: `choices=` allowed one protocol while the consuming line splits
  combined values. Every combined depth was unreachable, and the planner's own command would have
  failed on every source.
- `content[0].text` assumed the first block is text. **Opus 5 runs adaptive thinking by default**
  and puts a `ThinkingBlock` first — and because it is *adaptive*, this fails **intermittently**.
  Fixed in three files.
- `max_tokens = 1000` for an extraction call. On Opus the whole budget went to thinking: one
  thinking block, `stop_reason=max_tokens`, no text. It was also already tight without thinking
  (a P1P2 extraction is ~1,800 tokens of JSON), so **some share of the existing corpus's empty and
  low-confidence fields is probably truncation, not the model having nothing to say.** Now 4000,
  with effort `low` on models that accept `output_config`.
- `extract_from_pdfs.py` had no session-token fallback.

**End-to-end verified** on *The Red House Mystery* at P1P2P3 on Opus: 22 fields, model recorded in
`_meta`, old extraction archived, **4 parts → 19**. Registry regenerated to 4,967 parts.

`docs/EXTRACTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` covers every error above for whoever runs the remaining 66.

### Verification

`check_godot_wiring.py` clean (8 scenes, 3 autoloads) · `test_crime_scene_map.py` 193 passed ·
`test_registry_staleness.py` all passed · `check_mystery_playable.py` 0 unwinnable · one real
generation · one real end-to-end extraction · the model bake-off across seven stories.
**No Godot binary here, so nothing was run in the engine — the client work wants one F5.**
Total API spend this session: roughly **$3**.

### Next session

1. **Run the extraction** (~66 sources, ~$9.85, about an hour) — `docs/EXTRACTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
   has the commands and every failure mode. Then re-measure axis coverage against the
   before-numbers recorded there.
2. **CLOUD** is its own session. Its first concrete step is small and cheap: `area_id` on evidence,
   adjacency on areas, and the culprit's path as a sequence — a schema change to a call already
   being paid for.
3. **The six live play-time call sites** are the standing divergence from the intended
   architecture, and single-player interrogation hits one of them on every question.
4. **The Godot crime-scene screen** — step 4 of the playtest build order, and the last thing
   between here and a playable PC loop.
5. Open decisions unchanged: item 18 (a BLOCKING coherence report still ships), item 17's
   BACKGROUND question, the brand marks' per-device split.

## Session 33 — August 20, 2026 (MYF: the answer screen and the plate device; CYM: registry staleness closed)

**Branch:** `claude/myf-cym-games-review-6ne9rs`, started from `main` @ `27ebc89`.

### First: the branch the harness handed over was stale

The session opened on a branch created at `f4a5efe` — that is `main`, *not* Session 32's tip, so
it did not contain the timer fix or either aesthetics pass. This is precisely the failure mode
both `CLAUDE.md` files document and warn about, and it was caught by checking the branch against
`main` before doing anything, per that warning. The branch had zero unique commits, so it
fast-forwarded onto Session 32's work with nothing lost.

**PR #20 is merged** (`27ebc89`), on the owner's call — `mergeable_state: clean`, base equal to
`main`'s tip, nothing stacked behind it. The session branch was then restarted from the new `main`.

### The answer screen (MYF `CLAUDE.md` item 50)

Owner's second note from the August 18 playtest — "too much going on… I read, I answer" — was the
top unstarted item. Item 48 predicted the plate device would be most of what it needed, and that
held up.

**The plate landed** (item 40's core rule, decided August 17, unbuilt until now). `.panel` is now
the ground colour with the texture switched off, no radius, no border, no shadow. Two things are
written down at the class because both are easy to break later: the `background-color` is the
*same token* as the ground rather than a colour that matches it, and the plate is only visible
because the 10% marks around it are not.

**Plates stack, and the gap between them turned out to be load-bearing.** At 10% mark strength a
16px gap is likely to contain no mark at all, so two adjacent plates merge into one tall block and
the device silently stops reading. `space-y-4` → `space-y-6` fixed it. This is the practical
corollary of item 40's own rule, and it is invisible until you put two plates next to each other
and look.

**A quiet thing the plate fixed for free:** `lib/difficultyColors.js` proved every step of its
ramp against the slate ground, but the question had been sitting on `game.card` since the ramp was
generated. Nothing was ever broken — a darker box only raised the ratio — but the guarantee was
theoretical. Now the plate *is* the ground, so the measured number and the rendered pixel finally
describe the same thing.

**The decluttering, in one sentence: everything said more than once is now said once.** Four
blocks each paired a countdown with a sentence (reading, the room's view of the exclusive window,
the answerer's view of it, the lock hint); they were never on screen together, so they were never
four things — they are one `AnswerStatus` selected by one if/else. Rendering them as four
independent `&&` blocks is what made the screen read as having four instructions even though one
was ever visible. The stake was on screen three times in three phrasings; it is now one line. The
locked count and the spent list are one margin line. The round rule keeps its words and loses its
box, sitting with the question where item 40 puts it. The standings are one plate rather than one
box per player.

**One settled decision was deliberately revisited, and it is flagged as such:** item 49 made
`RoundLine` "the first line inside whichever box leads the page". It now has one fixed home — the
standings band — which keeps that decision's actual point (the fact is written once, never twice)
while taking a line out of the reading column and putting round data upper-left where item 40 says
chrome goes. A one-line revert if the owner disagrees.

### The preview harness, and what looking at things actually bought

`app/dev/answer` renders every Flow B moment from fixtures — instantly, for nothing, `?only=N` for
one at a time. Judging this screen previously meant playing a real three-player game with real
Claude calls until the state you wanted came up, and "the room's view during the exclusive window"
could not be produced on demand at all.

It reports any element overflowing the viewport, because a horizontal overflow has now broken a
phone twice and both times the build was happy while the screenshot showed only that *something*
was cut, never what.

**It paid for itself on its first run, in both directions:**

- A 390px "break" that was about to be chased was **not a bug**. Headless Chromium was laying the
  page out at 500px and screenshotting the left 390 of it. Without the reporter printing
  `viewport 500`, a working layout would have been "fixed". **`--window-size` does not set the
  layout viewport in headless Chromium** — drive it through Playwright's `viewport` option or the
  width being judged is not the width that was asked for.
- The real bug it found: **`flex-1` does not let the answer input shrink**, because a flex item
  defaults to `min-width: auto`. Submit sat 22px off the right edge at 390px — and *only* on the
  answerer's screen, since "Submit" is one word and cannot wrap its way out of the squeeze the way
  "Lock It In" does. `min-w-0`. All six states are now clean at 390 and at 1280.

### Verification

`scripts/mechanics-test.js` (105), `scripts/postgame-test.js`, `server_py/test_mechanics.py` (63)
and `server_py/test_turn_timers.py` (12) all pass; `npm run build` clean; every state rendered and
looked at in Chromium at both widths. No server code was touched.

### Part 2 — CYM: the part registry now notices when the corpus has moved on

Found by measurement during the review pass, then fixed in the same session once the MYF work was
committed. **It was live in the repo until this session:** `part_registry.json` held 4,807 parts /
556 sources against a fresh build's **4,952 / 569**, so 13 sources — extracted at real API cost,
written to disk correctly — were simply never sampled by generation.

**Worth being precise about what the bug was, because it is easy to misread as a data-migration
problem.** Nothing was in the wrong place and nothing needed moving. `part_registry.json` is a
*derived index*: generation samples it, never the extraction files themselves. `load_registry()`
rebuilt it only when the file was **missing**, never when it was out of date.

**And the diagnosis this session first reached was wrong, so it is worth writing down correctly.**
The initial read — carried in this file and in two commit messages before being corrected — was
"the extraction runs happened and nobody regenerated the registry afterwards". Checking the
history rather than the file counts says otherwise: `20c3ee3` (owner, August 10, "Corpus:
anthology extractions + regenerated part_registry") **did** regenerate it, and no extraction files
were added after it at all.

What actually happened is worse. The 20 extraction files absent from the index that commit
produced were added **in that same commit**, and they cluster — ten stories from *Best American
2016 (Elizabeth George)*, three from *2007 (Hiaasen)*, which are the 13 that yield parts, plus 7
that yield none. That is the signature of the regeneration running while those two books were
still extracting, with everything committed together afterwards. Git cannot prove the ordering
(one commit, no intermediate timestamps) and nothing else explains the clustering.

**So the failure mode was a race, not neglect** — a long extraction run against a manual
regeneration step — which is the stronger argument for the check: doing the conscientious thing
still silently lost 13 sources, and a reminder in a doc would not have helped. The March 11 →
Session 23 instance (~75 sources) was the plain "never rebuilt" version of the same gap.

**The check is a corpus fingerprint**, in a sidecar `part_registry.meta.json`: the hashed set of
extraction filenames, plus a schema version. Filenames are the right unit because
`load_extractions()` derives every `source_id` from the filename stem, so a change to that set is
exactly a change to the sources covered.

**It is deliberately not mtime-based**, which is what item 14 originally proposed (copying
`craft_grounding.py`'s index cache). A fresh `git clone` stamps every file with the checkout time,
so mtimes here carry no information about what was built when — comparing them would either miss
real staleness or rebuild on every clone. The cost of that choice is written down rather than
hidden: an extraction file edited *in place*, keeping its name, is not detected; `force=True` is
the escape hatch.

`REGISTRY_SCHEMA_VERSION` covers the second staleness mode, the one no amount of looking at the
corpus can catch: Session 23 changed `KEY_TO_IDX`, so identical files produced different parts and
the cache had no way to know.

**`scripts/test_registry_staleness.py`** (new, zero API cost) asserts both halves, because the
cheap way to pass "it detects staleness" is to rebuild unconditionally. That an unchanged corpus
genuinely reuses the cache is proved by corrupting the cached file and confirming the corruption
**survives** — a rebuild would have repaired it.

The same review pass answers root `CLAUDE.md` item 7's "next session should check" list: the
anthology extraction runs did happen — 281 `pdf_*` extractions, up from 75; 570 extraction files
total — run locally by the owner and landed in `20c3ee3`.

**One thing found on the way and left open:** 7 of those anthology extractions are all-null —
every P1 field `null` at `confidence: "low"`, with **no `_meta.extraction_warnings`**, so by item
13's logic they read as a genuine "nothing found" rather than a caught parse failure. For seven
mystery short stories that is implausible. They also occupy filenames, and dedup is by filename,
so a re-run skips them unless they are deleted first. Listed by name in root `CLAUDE.md` item 7.
Not diagnosed — it needs someone to look at one against its source PDF.

### Part 3 — MYF: two live-type title treatments, and the coherence engine wired

**The metallic logotype is retired** (item 50 in MYF `CLAUDE.md` is the answer screen; this is
item 52's territory). The owner supplied two font treatments — F1 (a heavy condensed sans) and D1
(Bebas Neue) — to be shown 50/50. The old asset was 2.1MB of path data whose 29 grey levels ran
`#0b0b06` → `#f4f3f1`, i.e. drawn for a light ground: on slate, roughly two-thirds of it fell
under 3.5:1 and simply was not there, which is what read as "dim". Live type has none of that,
weighs nothing, and is real text — selectable, searchable, screen-readable.

Both faces load via `next/font/google`, which **self-hosts** the woff2 at build time (verified in
`.next/static/media` — neither falls back), so there is no runtime request to Google and the game
renders with no internet. Both colours were measured against the ground rather than trusted:
6.14:1 and 6.02:1, which clears AA and — the useful part — puts the pair within 0.12 of itself, so
neither half reads as heavier than the other.

**The part that was wrong first, and is why `scripts/wordmark-test.js` exists.** "50/50 randomly"
hides two properties, and the obvious implementation gets the second one wrong. A second
polynomial hash then `% 2` measures as a *perfect* 50.00/50.00 split and is still **perfectly
correlated** with the logo's palette rotation: every odd multiplier collapses to the same parity
bit mod 2, and because 6 is even, `hash % 6` carries that identical parity. Palette 0 always drew
one treatment, palette 1 always the other — twelve visual combinations quietly became six, and
nothing about the overall split revealed it. Salting the seed does not help; it only swaps which
half is which. Fixed by mixing the bits (murmur3 finaliser) before the modulus. The test walks all
331,776 possible room codes and checks the **joint** distribution, not the marginal one: worst
deviation within a palette is now 0.36 points.

Selection is deterministic in the room code, exactly as `Logo.jsx` already defines it for the
palette and for its stated reason — a mark that differs per screen reads as a rendering bug. So
50/50 means across *games*.

**MYF's coherence rules are now wired to the shared engine** (item 51, MYF item 8 — the owner's
cross-title ask from the top of the session). The pillar had one real consumer, CYM's
`coherence_validator.py`; it has two now, and `server_py/test_coherence_engine.py` asserts both
titles use the *identical* `RuleSet` / `CoherenceReport` / `Issue` classes rather than two copies
sharing field names — the check that would actually catch the framework forking.

**The obstacle was a name collision, and it is worth remembering because it will recur.**
`server_py/coherence.py` and the root `coherence/` package cannot both sit on `sys.path`: whichever
is found first wins, `server_py/` is always first, so `from coherence.engine import RuleSet`
resolved to MYF's own file and raised `"'coherence' is not a package"`. No import ordering fixes
it. The file is now `coherence_rules.py` — the more accurate name regardless, since it assembles
constraints and validates questions while the engine is the shared thing it plugs into — and the
repo-root `sys.path` entry is **appended**, not inserted, so `server_py`'s own modules keep winning
future collisions.

One real behavioural gain came free with using the engine's report instead of a dict: the call site
now logs on **warnings** as well as failures. The old `if not validation["passed"]` swallowed every
WARNING, which is precisely where "generation ignored the round rule" shows up. That was a blind
spot, not a formatting difference.

### Part 4 — CYM: BACKGROUND designed (no code written)

Owner-initiated diversion at the end of the session: bring MYF's look and feel to CYM. **Design
only — nothing was built.** Full spec, decisions and open questions in root `CLAUDE.md` item 17;
the short version:

CYM gets MYF's *system* (ground colour + a faded strewn mark tile), **not** its motif — the
question marks stay MYF's, and CYM's marks are the mystery's own title, so the two titles read as
siblings rather than one game reskinned. This knowingly reverses MYF item 39's "MYF only, do not
generalise" line, at the owner's direction.

**The design changed shape mid-conversation, and the owner's version is better.** The first
proposal worked around the fact that `title` does not exist until generation ends (112s–1992s in
the real batch data): stream the generation call and parse `title` out early, since it is field #1
in the schema. That is sound and costs nothing extra, but it modifies the main generation path.
The owner's counter — **prompt the player for a title alongside the setting and use theirs** —
removes the streaming dependency entirely, touches no generation code, and makes the original
two-state spec literally true. It is also what players already do: `submit_prompt`'s own docstring
examples are "Smurf murder mystery" and "Mystery on Mars". Streaming is kept only as the fallback
for a blank title.

Decided: the **server** computes a seeded layout and **both clients render it** — CYM has two
(the Godot host screen and `server/static/mobile.html`), and one layout means the TV and every
phone show the identical field instead of two renderers drifting.

**The unresolved item is moderation, and it is the owner's call.** A player-supplied string would
be rendered large, repeated, on every screen, for a whole game, on a TV, in a Steam title — the
highest-visibility user-generated content surface in the product, and MYF already built
`moderateHeckle()` for a much smaller one. It cannot ride along on generation because the
background appears before any Claude call.

### Part 5 — CYM: the BACKGROUND generator built, and the brand artwork measured

**Built:** `background_field.py` — where the mystery's own title is strewn across the page. Pure,
deterministic, zero API calls, and independent of both open owner decisions, which is why it could
go ahead while those wait. Python and runtime rather than a build script, because CYM's motif is a
title that does not exist until a player types it. The server computes the layout and both clients
draw it; it returns JSON placements, not an image.

Three things came out of *rendering* it rather than reasoning about it, and each is now a test in
`scripts/test_background_field.py` (31 assertions, zero cost):

- **Sizing must ignore title length.** Scaling each mark so the whole title spans a set fraction
  of the tile — the obvious approach — shrank a 39-character title to 15px and, because thin
  strips carry less ink, made the budget ask for *more* of them. Sixty tiny strips is a mat, not a
  texture. Size is now absolute and long titles crop at the edge.
- **Placement must be a jittered grid.** At 8–40 marks, uniform randomness reliably left a bare
  quarter of the tile, which reads as a rendering failure rather than as sparseness.
- **Mark strength does not need to go below MYF's 10%.** The prediction that it would — because
  words are read involuntarily where an abstract glyph is not — was wrong: the marks are mostly
  rotated and cropped, so they do not read as words. 5% is too faint, 7% is the default, 10% also
  works. Still wants a real screen.

**A bug no rendering would have caught:** the published 8% brass appeared 0% of the time, always.
Shares were rounded independently (which overshoots the total) and the bag was then truncated from
the end — where the smallest share happens to be declared. Fixed with largest-remainder
apportionment, then again with a *weighted* remainder draw, because deterministic largest-remainder
handed the leftover slots to the same colours in every field forever: a systematic 7-point bias.
**`mind-your-friends/scripts/build-question-field.mjs` has the same round-then-truncate shape** and
is fine today only because its numbers happen to sum to exactly 44.

**Brand artwork.** The owner supplied two marks, then re-cut them as true vectors. Both rounds are
in `brand/`; full status in root `CLAUDE.md` item 17. Headline: the re-cut achieved its goal (real
paths, no base64), and the contrast problem is unchanged because it converted format rather than
values — 53% and 73% of ink at or below 2.5:1 on the slate ground. Being vector makes the fix
cheap: a fill rewrite instead of a pixel filter, which matters because the pixel filter tried here
produced rainbow speckle on the near-black regions.

`scripts/check_brand_contrast.py` (new, zero cost) measures any mark against the ground. It crops
to the SVG viewBox — one asset carried 22,445 opaque artifact pixels outside its viewBox that
dragged a measurement from 49% to 62% — and reports a distribution rather than a mean, because
these marks are bimodal and an average would describe no pixel in them.

### Next session

**Pick up here: root `CLAUDE.md` item 17.** Two owner decisions are outstanding (moderation; and
whether the player's title feeds into generation or only decorates). Everything else is settled
enough to build.

1. **Re-run the playtest.** Two reasons now: item 47's timer fix has never been played, and the
   answer screen has been rebuilt. PT-4 → PT-8 are still open and the August 18 verdicts are not
   evidence.
2. **Open owner decisions, unchanged and none blocking:** the three `#7c3aed` entries in
   `LOGO_PALETTES`; Spotlight's 1-second exclusive window (PT-6); whether the lobby punchline
   stays the mark. New this session: whether `RoundLine` should stay in the standings band.
3. **Owner action item, still open:** the metallic title treatment renovation. Drop-in at
   `public/brand/myf_title_trtmnt_trans.svg`, keep 587×69, no code change. It is visibly dim in
   every screenshot taken this session.
4. Still queued and untouched: `questionLog`/`postGame` in `server_py` (item 46), item 44's two
   tabled tuning follow-ups, and wiring MYF's coherence to the shared Python engine (item 8) —
   the last of those being the cross-title work the owner opened this session asking about.

---

## Session 32 — August 18, 2026 (MYF: the first Flow B playtest, and the bug it found)

**Branch:** `claude/myf-flow-b-playtest-xv2lqh`, started from `main` @ `f4a5efe` (PR #19's merge,
i.e. Session 31's tip — checked, not assumed, per this file's branch-hygiene warning).

Session 31 ended with "play it". The owner played it — three players — and reported that the
timing felt good **except** that one question, three turns in, had an answer window that was over
almost as soon as it opened. Everything below came out of chasing that one observation.

### It was a bug, not a tuning problem

**Every server timer was scoped to a phase, not to a turn**, on both backends. `server.js` and
`server_py/main.py` each arm four timers — the card window, Flow B's exclusive window, the answer
window, and the next-turn scheduler — and each fire-time guard was `if (game.phase !== 'X')
return`. That reads as sufficient. It is not, and the reason is the whole bug: **every turn walks
the same phases.** A timer left over from a question that ended early doesn't find a phase
mismatch and no-op; it finds the *next* question sitting in exactly the phase it was armed for,
and acts on it.

Concretely, on the default 40s clock (a 45s ANSWER phase):
- A question answered at second 8 leaves its 45s answer timer pending with 37s to run.
- The next question opens once the turn cycle completes (RESULT screen + category + wager + card
  window + generation).
- The leftover timer then fires partway through that question and **expires it**, with the
  on-screen countdown still visibly running — the client derives its countdown from
  `answerOpensAt`/`buzzOpensAt`, which belong to the current question and know nothing about it.
- Truncation ≈ `answerWindow − whenTheLastQuestionResolved − turnCycle`, so it needs a fast
  question *and* a fast cycle to bite — which is why it surfaces a few turns in rather than
  immediately.
- **It compounds.** A question truncated at second 20 leaves a timer with 25s still on it, so the
  question after that one is shorter again, until a window is shorter than the turn cycle.

**The worse half, same cause.** A stale *exclusive-window* timer reads `answererIndex` at fire
time — the NEW answerer — sees no attempt from them, and therefore charges them their wager for
freezing on a question they had barely seen, locks them out of it (`"You already had your shot at
this one"`), and records an inactivity strike. Two strikes marks a player away and starts skipping
their turns. That one is a scoring error, not just a pacing one, and it is the part that would
have quietly poisoned the playtest's other numbers.

### The fix

A turn sequence number, not a rewrite. `game.turnSeq` / `game["turnSeq"]`, bumped in
`beginTurn()` / `_begin_turn()` — the single funnel every turn start already passes through,
including `resumeAfterDrop`. Each timer captures it when armed and returns early if it has moved
by the time it fires. Four timers per backend, one line each, no behaviour change to any timer
doing its own job.

### Verification

- **`server_py/test_turn_timers.py` (new, zero API cost).** Drives `main.py`'s real
  `threading.Timer` callbacks in-process — `_broadcast_sync` no-ops with no captured event loop,
  so no uvicorn is needed — on a shortened clock, and asserts both halves: a finished turn's
  timers cannot touch the next turn (window intact, answerer not charged, not locked out, no
  inactivity strike), **and** a turn's own timers still fire on their own deadline with the freeze
  charge landing correctly. The second half is not padding: the cheap way to pass the first half
  is to make every timer a no-op.
- **Confirmed it actually catches the bug**: with the guard stashed, 4 assertions fail; restored,
  all 11 pass. A regression test that was never seen to fail isn't one.
- `server_py/test_mechanics.py` (63), `scripts/mechanics-test.js` (105), `scripts/postgame-test.js`,
  and `npm run build` — all still green.

**Known asymmetry, stated rather than papered over:** the JS fix is the same four lines but has no
automated coverage. `server.js`'s orchestration lives inside `app.prepare().then(...)` and isn't
importable, so there's no harness to hang a test on — that was true before this change too. Worth
restructuring if a second orchestration bug turns up; not worth it for this one.

### What this costs the playtest

PLAYTEST.md PT-4 → PT-8 are **not** answered by this session. Any question that followed a
quickly-answered one was running on a clock shorter than the design says, so the table was
measuring a broken clock and its timing verdicts aren't evidence about the 8s exclusive window,
the 5s reading window, or whether the lock window is long enough. A banner saying so is now at the
top of PLAYTEST.md. The one number that survives is a negative: nothing about the *wager ladder*
or the 0.75x payout depends on the timers, so those are still open on their own terms.

The owner's second note from the same session — the answer screen has too much on it, and the
experience wants to be "I read, I answer" — is a real design item and is where the next session
starts.

### Part 2 — the aesthetics work (same session, after the fix)

Owner's steer: "again we are starting with aesthetics". Four global instructions, then three
screens one at a time, each arriving as a screenshot plus a numbered list.

**Global (MYF `CLAUDE.md` item 48).** The question-mark field is now on every page — item 40's
ground, built rather than only decided, generated by `scripts/build-question-field.mjs` and laid
on `body` so no screen can forget it. The official title treatment
(`myf_title_trtmnt_trans.svg`) replaced the traced mono mask, upper left, on every page including
phones: **a CSS mask keeps only the silhouette**, and this artwork's 29 grey levels are the point
of it. The logo is 66% bigger and one size everywhere (`LOGO_HEIGHT = 73`, replacing a 44 in the
bar overriding a 40 default). Purple is gone — `game.accent` `#7c3aed` → `#F7C948`.

The accent swap has one non-obvious consequence worth remembering: **the accent went from a dark
colour to a light one**, so every solid `bg-game-accent` surface needed dark text in the same
pass. White on this gold is 1.7:1.

**Three screens (item 49).** Card Select (names atop at up to 2x, type at bottom, cards 33%
smaller, Half-Off shown in-grid with a check instead of explained in a sentence); Set Wager
("Slice" gone, EASIEST/HARDEST on the ends of the ladder, smaller Lock In); Generating Question
(one `.panel` colour for every box, `Round 1: Question 1 of 6` as the announcement's top line,
the floating duplicate between the boxes deleted).

**What the method actually bought.** Every change was checked by driving the real app in headless
Chromium and looking at the screenshot. Three things were caught that way and by nothing else:
the brand bar broke at 390px once the logo was fixed at 73px (the build was perfectly happy);
"2x names" and "33% smaller cards" are mutually impossible at face value — "Whoa Nellie" rendered
as "Who / a / Nelli / e", which is what turned a flat size into a ceiling with a fit calculation
under it; and the in-hand check mark ran over the longest names until the spacer became a float
rather than padding.

**Deliberately not done, and flagged to the owner:** `#7c3aed` still appears three times in
`LOGO_PALETTES`, where it is one of the three emoji colours rather than text. The instruction was
about purple *text*, and item 40 already carries an open note that those palettes want a pass now
the ground is slate — they are one decision, not two. Also not done: the **plate device** (item
40's core rule). Panels are still the pre-slate dark navy, which reads as a card floating above
the field rather than a hole cut through it. `.panel` is the single place that changes when it
happens.

### Where this session ended

**Branch `claude/myf-flow-b-playtest-xv2lqh`, four commits, open as PR #20 (not merged).**

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `7c4adb5` | Turn-scoped timer guards, both backends + `test_turn_timers.py` |
| `cb19f6c` | Question-mark ground, official title treatment, logo size, purple → gold; Card Select, Set Wager, Generating Question |
| `cd6ce04` | Lobby: treatment as hero, four imperatives |
| `dc6f3d7` | Lobby: hero dropped, punchline set as the mark |

**Owner has taken an action item off this list:** they are renovating the metallic title
treatment artwork themselves. The integration is already a drop-in — `Wordmark.jsx` renders
`public/brand/myf_title_trtmnt_trans.svg` as a plain `<img>`, so a new file at that path needs no
code change. Keep the 587×69 aspect and nothing reflows. **The renovation brief, from measuring
the current asset:** its 29 grey levels run `#0b0b06` → `#f4f3f1`, i.e. it was drawn for a light
ground, and on slate everything below about `#9d9c94` falls under 3.5:1 and simply is not there.
Roughly two-thirds of the artwork is invisible, which is what reads as "dim". A recolour will not
fix that — the shading has to be re-pitched into the top half of the value scale, **or** the
treatment needs a light plate under it, which is a change to item 40's plate device and therefore
one decision with it, not two.

### Next session

1. **Interface cleanup on the answer screen** — owner's stated priority since the playtest, and
   still not started: "too much going on… I read, I answer." Note that the plate device (item 40)
   is probably most of what this needs, and `.panel` in `globals.css` is now the single place it
   lands.
2. **Re-run the playtest on the fixed build**, then read PT-4 → PT-8 for real. The August 18
   table measured a broken clock; its timing verdicts are not evidence.
3. **Merge PR #20** (or say what's blocking it). Four commits, all verified, nothing else stacked
   behind it.
4. **Open owner decisions**, none blocking:
   - The three `#7c3aed` entries in `LOGO_PALETTES` — the same purple that was rejected as text,
     still on screen in the emoji mark. One decision with item 40's "palettes want a pass now the
     ground is slate", not two.
   - The plate device itself (item 40's core rule): panels are still pre-slate dark navy.
   - Spotlight's 1-second exclusive window (PT-6) — worth deciding rather than watching, and it
     was the other candidate explanation for this session's short window.
   - Lobby punchline: currently set as the mark itself rather than type. A one-line revert if the
     owner wanted type.
5. Still queued and untouched: `questionLog`/`postGame` in `server_py` (item 46, the only thing
   blocking a Godot post-game screen), and item 44's two tabled tuning follow-ups (wager tier
   simplification; widening the colour ramp), both of which the playtest re-run may change.

## Session 31 — August 17, 2026 (MYF: Flow B built, pre-committed answers, the wager ladder, server_py port)

**Branch:** `claude/flow-b-implementation-2lwwmt` (started from Session 30's tip, `ec485ac` — the
harness handed over a branch pointing at `main`, which was 7 days stale and missing all of
Session 30; checked before working, per this file's own branch-hygiene warning).

Session 30 stopped at "build Flow B, then play it". This session built it, and the owner
redesigned two mechanics mid-build, so the shape that landed is not quite the shape that was
spec'd. All the design calls below are the owner's.

### What landed, in order

**1. Flow B — the answerer's exclusive window** (`dd67a48`). After the 5s reading window the
answerer gets `ACTIVE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (8, capped at 25% of the round rule's clock) alone with
their own question. Answering or passing opens the buzzer immediately; the window expiring
charges them the wager. The pass/timeout split Session 30 flagged as load-bearing is built
exactly as written: **folding is a decision and costs nothing, freezing is a failure and costs
the wager.**

**2. Pre-committed answers** (`3c3eac3`) — **owner's redesign, mid-build.** Everyone except the
answerer types and LOCKS an answer *during* the answerer's exclusive window; a buzz plays that
committed answer, and you cannot type one after the fumble. Owner's stated aim was anti-cheat,
and it does that — the moment worth looking something up is the one after the answerer fails,
with the whole remaining clock, and that moment no longer accepts new answers. It also does two
things the owner didn't ask for but which are arguably bigger: buzzing stops being a **typing
race** and becomes one tap, and the room is **busy** during the exclusive window rather than
watching. Owner confirmed: no lock, no buzz — a player who never committed sits it out.

Two rules that took real thought, both load-bearing:
- **The lock deadline never moves.** A pass brings the *buzzer* forward but not the lock
  deadline. Tying them would mean folding at second one cuts the room off mid-sentence and the
  question dies with nobody able to buzz.
- **A question nobody can answer ends immediately** rather than running the clock down. Found
  while writing the tests, not by design — with pre-commitment it is now genuinely possible for
  a fumbled question to be unanswerable, which the old free-for-all could never produce.

**3. The buzz payout: 0.75× the wager, not a flat 100.** Owner asked whether a flat 100 was a
lot or a little and said they had no context for the point space. That is answerable with
arithmetic, so `scripts/economy-sim.js` (`ad62d67`) now models it — zero API cost, payout
formula imported rather than copied so it can't drift, every behavioural assumption a named
knob. Owner proposed 1.5×, then 0.75×. **0.75× is right and 1.5× is not**, for a reason that
isn't the one I first gave: the setter-bias objection applies to both but is small at 0.75×
(break-even moves from 50% to ~55%). What actually kills 1.5× is that a buzzer would earn 300 on
a question the answerer could only win 200 on **while risking nothing**, inverting the risk
hierarchy of the whole game. Any share under 1 keeps it upright. The owner's own point in favour
is the best one: **a share scales with whatever wager range gets settled later.**

**4. The wager ladder, the pie, and difficulty-coloured questions** (`f31612f`) — all owner-led.
- **`12 / 25 / 50 / 100 / 200`** replaces the 50–500 slider, which the owner flagged as feeling
  arbitrary. It was, measurably: 46 values across a range whose ends were both wrong (a 50 swung
  ~4% of a typical winning margin, a 500 swung 43%), at a resolution finer than any decision a
  person can make. A doubling ladder anchored at 100 = the whole pie is self-describing, and
  spreads 3/6/12/23/47%.
- **The pie** (`components/WagerPie.jsx`) — owner's idea. 200 is an oversized pie with a dashed
  ring outside the crust, the only tier that breaks the shape's own scale.
- **Question text printed in a green keyed to the tier.** Honest rather than decorative: the
  wager genuinely drives difficulty, and difficulty is now five rungs matching the ladder
  instead of three buckets normalised from a continuous range.
- **The colour ramp is generated and contrast-validated** (`scripts/build-difficulty-colors.mjs`,
  which refuses to write a ramp with any step under 4.5:1). This mattered: the owner's reference
  spectrum ran to `#26501A`, which on the slate ground is **1.2:1** — invisible. **The tension
  worth not rediscovering: on a dark ground, "darker" and "readable" pull against each other.**
  The ramp deepens by saturation instead, pale mint to full sage. A literal light-to-dark green
  needs the question on a *light* plate, i.e. a change to item 40's plate device — flagged to the
  owner as a separate decision rather than quietly reversed.

**5. `server_py` port** (`0324ef8`) — the answer flow, per-round rules and the lazy fact bank,
i.e. everything item 42 had paused. Start went from a blocking build to **9ms**, measured.

### The hard part, and how it was actually solved

Session 30 predicted it correctly: "first correct wins" must mean first *submission*, not first
API response. Node gets that free from one event loop plus one promise chain.

What the note didn't say, and what matters: **a plain `threading.Lock` does not substitute.**
Python locks make no FIFO promise, so two threads blocked on one can be granted in either order —
exactly the coin flip this exists to avoid. The fix is a **ticket lock**: each attempt takes a
ticket in the same critical section that claims its attempt slot (so the order cannot be
interleaved), then waits its turn on a `threading.Condition` with **no game lock held**, because
the evaluation is an API call and holding `_games_lock` across it would freeze the whole room.
`main.py`'s endpoints do that two-step explicitly — claim under the lock, resolve with it
released.

`server_py/test_mechanics.py` proves it rather than assuming it: it starts the **later** claim's
thread **first**. A naive implementation hands the win to the wrong player there.

### Found by running it, not by reading it

`claude_client.py` never received the JS `LENGTH_RULE`, so the Python backend had **no 8–20 word
constraint on questions at all**. A real generated question came back at ~45 words — which under
a shared buzzer tests reading speed rather than knowledge, and is longer than the reading window
is sized for. Applied to both generation prompts. This is the argument for live-running a port
instead of trusting a careful translation.

### Verification

- `scripts/mechanics-test.js` — **105 assertions**, zero API cost.
- `server_py/test_mechanics.py` — **63 assertions**, zero API cost, including the thread race.
- `scripts/postgame-test.js` — still passing.
- `npm run build` — clean.
- A real `uvicorn` process driven over HTTP + WebSocket: instant start, round-1 announcement,
  background prefetch, and every Flow B gate returning the right code (lock refused during
  reading / accepted after / immutable once set; buzz refused in the exclusive window and refused
  with no lock; pass accepted; committed buzz accepted; `RESULT` reporting `activeOutcome:
  "passed"` with `wagerLost: false`).
- `test_start_progress.py` deleted — its subject, a blocking fact-bank build at start, no longer
  exists. Same call the JS side made with `start-progress-test.js`.

### NOT done — read this before assuming the feature is finished

**Nothing here has been played by real people.** Four numbers are guesses: the 8s exclusive
window, the 5s reading window, whether the lock window gives enough time to commit, and whether
0.75× makes buzzing feel worth doing. PLAYTEST.md PT-4 through PT-8 are the watch-list. **No
further mechanic work should go in front of a table.**

Also not done: `questionLog`/`postGame` in `server_py` (MYF `CLAUDE.md` item 46 — the only thing
still blocking a Godot post-game screen), and the owner-tabled item 44 (wager tier
simplification; widening the colour ramp toward blue-green/yellow-green).

### Next session

1. **Play it.** Instructions were given to the owner; short-game env vars in MYF `CLAUDE.md` →
   Common Tasks reach GAME_OVER in ~3 minutes instead of ~25.
2. Then `questionLog`/`postGame` in `server_py` (item 46), which unblocks the Godot post-game
   screen.
3. Item 44's two owner-tabled follow-ups, once a table has been played — both are tuning
   decisions and a playtest may change what the right tuning is.
