"""Is the story connected? Checks the narrative the way check_solvability checks the arithmetic.

The coherence engine has 26 rules and almost all of them ask "is this field
present?" or "are there enough of this kind?". Two do referential integrity, and
both check structured fields -- solution.culprit against characters[], and
key_evidence IDs against evidence[]. NOTHING checks the prose, which is where
the story actually is.

That gap is not theoretical. `daggers_in_the_forum` scores passed=True,
blocking=0, warnings=0 -- a clean sweep -- and its deduction turns on Apolonios,
Demetrios and Senator Manilius, none of whom appear in its own character list.
A player cannot meet, question or accuse any of them. The mystery is provably
structured and narratively broken, and every existing check passes it.

Three things are checked here, in ascending strictness:

  CAST      A person named in the deduction chain who is not in characters[].
            Works on every mystery ever generated. This is the daggers defect.

  LINKS     Session 38 reordered generation to write the solution FIRST and made
            each clue declare what it serves -- `supports` naming chain steps,
            `exonerates` and `implicates` naming suspects. Where those fields
            exist, coherence becomes graph reachability and is checked exactly:
            every link resolves, every step is supported, elimination leaves
            exactly the culprit. Mysteries without the fields predate the change
            and are reported as legacy, not failed.

  ORPHAN    A name that appears ONLY inside the solution -- nowhere in the cast,
            the evidence, the areas or the leads. The player cannot encounter it
            by any route.

  NARROWS   Item 27's glove. An evidence item may carry `narrows` -- the suspects
            still possible given a physical fact ("a bloody man's glove"). It is
            hidden bookkeeping; the prose states the fact and the player draws
            the line. Checked here: a narrowing that excludes the culprit (the
            mystery contradicting its own solution and punishing correct
            reasoning -- M3 Clue Fairness), a narrowing naming one suspect (the
            answer printed on a finding), a narrowing naming somebody who is not
            a suspect, prose that gives the inference away instead of stating
            the fact, and narrowing that has become load-bearing so a withheld
            glove could make the case unprovable.

  REVEALS   APF deals findings rather than letting players gather them, and only
            evidence[] carries elimination data. A witness statement and a lead
            result reach it through a `reveals` pointer naming the evidence they
            surface (see deal.py). Checked here: a pointer resolving to no
            evidence item, a witness or lead carrying no pointer at all, and an
            exoneration reachable ONLY as a crime-scene clue -- which would make
            witness and lead findings decorative, since a clue is always
            available anyway.

ON FALSE POSITIVES, HONESTLY. Extracting people from prose is a heuristic. A
mystery may legitimately name someone who is not a character -- Pompey in a
Roman setting, a courier nobody questions. NOT_PEOPLE below is a curated
stoplist and it will need adding to. Treat CAST findings as a list to triage,
not a verdict, and prefer fixing a real one over growing the stoplist.

Exit is non-zero only for mysteries generated under the CURRENT schema, so the
legacy corpus does not hold the suite red. See SCHEMA_EPOCH.
