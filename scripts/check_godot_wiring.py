"""
Pre-playtest wiring check for the Godot client. Zero API cost, no Godot binary.

Godot only reports a bad `$NodePath` or a forgotten `.connect()` at runtime --
the first as an error the moment the scene loads, the second as silence. A
button that was never connected looks completely correct in the editor, in the
scene file and in the script; it simply does nothing when a playtester clicks
it. That is how MainMenu's "Browse Saved Mysteries" popup shipped inert.

This checks three things across every scene/script pair:

  1. Every `$Path` a script dereferences exists in its scene.
  2. Every `@onready var x: T = $Path` matches the node's actual type in the
     scene (a wrong type is a crash on first use, not on load).
  3. Every interactive control in the scene is referenced by the script at all
     -- the cheap proxy for "this control does something".
  4. Every `GameState.x` / `ApiClient.x` / `NetworkManager.x` a UI script
     touches actually exists on that autoload, and is called with an argument
     count the definition accepts.

Check 3 is a lint, not a proof: it cannot tell a deliberately-decorative
control from a forgotten one, so it reports NOTE rather than FAIL. Checks 1
and 2 are real failures.

Usage:  python3 scripts/check_godot_wiring.py
Exit:   0 = no failures (notes may still be printed), 1 = failures found
