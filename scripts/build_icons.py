"""Flatten the icon sets to the palette and generate the client copies. Zero API cost.

    python3 scripts/build_icons.py --check  # fail if they have drifted
    python3 scripts/build_icons.py --report # describe what is in the sources

Sources live in icons/clue/ and icons/witness/ — see icons/README.md. Filenames
carry no meaning; the folder assigns the set.

WHY FLATTEN. The icons arrive as multi-hue gradients (amber, blue, magenta,
green, red, cyan, orange, violet). The game is slate and brass with exactly one
warm accent, rationed on purpose — background_field.py's own comment records
what happened when the brass share went to 16% ("the warm marks read as a
different, louder element rather than as part of one texture"). Eight hues would
do that to the whole interface. So every gradient, fill and stroke in an icon
collapses to a single value.

WHY WHITE FOR GODOT AND currentColor FOR THE PHONE. Godot's SVG importer
rasterises with the colours in the file and has no notion of currentColor, so a
Godot icon is recoloured by MODULATING its texture — and modulate multiplies,
which means a white source can become any palette colour and a pre-tinted one
cannot. CSS has the opposite affordance, so the phone copy defers to
currentColor and the stylesheet decides. One source, two mechanisms, no third
copy of the palette.

RASTER SOURCES. A .png in a set folder is handled too, and is second choice
rather than an error: a bitmap cannot be re-cut or re-weighted and cannot scale
past its own resolution, which matters because CYM's host screen is a
television. Flattening one is simpler than flattening vector, because the alpha
channel already IS the artwork — the RGB is discarded and every pixel becomes
white at its original opacity, giving a coverage mask. Godot multiplies that by
a palette colour with modulate; CSS does the same with `mask-image` plus a
`background-color`, which is why the phone copy of a raster icon is the same
white file rather than a currentColor one.

WHAT IT REFUSES. A raster embedded in an SVG wrapper. The rewrite works on paint
attributes, so a base64 <image> passes through untouched and would arrive in the
product as the only multi-coloured thing in it. brand/negative_logo.svg and
brand/organic_logo.svg were exactly that shape and had to be re-cut, so this is
a failure rather than a warning.
