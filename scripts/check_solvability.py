"""Audit the structural link between a mystery's evidence and its solution.

docs/INVESTIGATION_DESIGN.md section 4 proposes a free interim check: parse the
evidence IDs out of `how_to_deduce` and confirm they COVER `key_evidence` -- on
the reasoning that an item the solution never mentions is not load-bearing and
should not be listed as key.

Run against all 17 generated mysteries on disk, that check passes everywhere.
Zero mysteries list a key item the reasoning ignores. The interesting failure is
the OTHER direction, and it is present in 16 of 17:

    the reasoning cites evidence that key_evidence does not contain.

Up to six items per mystery, a mean of about three. That matters more than the
direction section 4 proposed, because APF's constrained deal is specified over
"the evidence that proves the case". If that set is read from `key_evidence`,
the deal can hand a player every key item and still not give them what the
solution's own reasoning uses. The deal would satisfy its constraints and the
player still could not get there.

So this script reports both directions and treats the second as the real one.

It also reports two things needed before section 4's `exonerates` field can be
added, because both bound what that field can do:

  * How many suspects there are. Eliminating down to one needs S-1 exonerations,
    so S sets how many findings can be provably load-bearing -- and therefore
    how many players can hold one. Generation currently produces 2-3 suspects
    while docs/PLAYTEST_FLOW.md specifies four.
  * Whether the reasoning names the non-culprit suspects at all. `exonerates` asks
    generation to state elimination as data; that is cheap if the prose already
    reasons that way and expensive if it does not.

Zero API cost -- it reads what is already on disk.

Usage:  python3 scripts/check_solvability.py [--verbose]
Exit:   0 always. This is a report, not a gate: nothing here is a defect in a
        mystery, it is a measurement of what generation currently produces.
