seat_players.py -- fill the other seats at the table so one person can walk APF.

WHY THIS EXISTS. APF needs at least two players: constraint 2 says no single
casefile may solve the case alone, and at one player the only casefile IS the
whole assignment. So the round screen cannot be walked solo -- and the phone
client cannot help yet, because server/static/mobile.html is built for the
pre-APF gather loop and calls /share-phase rather than /apf/share. A phone
would join, never meet the round-2 checkpoint, and the host screen would
correctly refuse to open round 3. The walk would stall two rounds in.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a bot player and it is not an AI opponent. It joins
seats and pays each share checkpoint with the bare minimum the server asks for,
which is the most withholding-heavy legal play. It never accuses, never opens a
round and never closes the case -- those are the host's, and the host is you.

So what you are walking is the real server, the real rhythm and the real board,
with the social half stubbed out. That is exactly the half a checker cannot
test anyway.

Run it while the host is sitting in the LOBBY, and wait for "At the table . 4"
before pressing OPEN THE CASE -- open_session snapshots who is in the room, so
anyone who arrives after the assignment is not in it. (This used to say "Begin
the investigation", the lobby button's old label; that is now the button on
CaseBrief's last page, which is after the snapshot point.)
