"""Fixture tests for arrangement.py — the pointer-wiring pass.

WHAT THESE ARE REALLY GUARDING. This tool's only dangerous failure is a FALSE
POSITIVE: wiring a witness to evidence their statement is not about. That
manufactures exactly the drift deal.py's docstring warns of ("a model can emit
reveals: ["E3"] on a statement that says nothing about E3, and nothing
structural can tell") -- and every checker would then go green over a lie.

Both false positives below are real ones this tool made during its own first
run, on real generated mysteries. They are the tests because they are the
mistakes:

  1. Scoring on shared vocabulary alone proposed wiring Nadege Fontenot's
     audience sign-in sheet to a witness whose statement is about somebody else
     buying taffy. Shared words: "else", "entire", "general", "show".
  2. Letting the person's name be its own corroboration proposed wiring that
     same alibi to the area holding her MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE. Both mention her;
     one is her alibi and the other is her motive.

A tool that refuses too often costs a cheap targeted call. A tool that wires too
eagerly costs the credibility of every check downstream of it.
