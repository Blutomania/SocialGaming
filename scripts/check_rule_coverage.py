"""Every hard assertion in the generation prompt — and what, if anything, enforces it.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT COST NOT TO HAVE IT. The generation prompt has said
"EXACTLY 4 suspects" since it was written. deal.py's entire constraint arithmetic
is derived from four. Nothing checked it, and `snow_on_the_engawa` came back with
three — which is not a smaller version of the same game but a different one, since
two required exonerations means any finding carrying both solves outright. That
cost a paid generation to discover, by accident.

It is a shape, not an incident. Three kinds of broken rule exist here, and one
session produced all three:

  INERT            declared somewhere, reachable from nothing.
                   Mechanically findable. Currently: none in the rule system.
  UNENFORCED       the prompt asserts it; no rule checks it.
                   THIS FILE. The "EXACTLY 4 suspects" shape.
  WRONGLY MEASURED a rule exists, runs, passes, and measures the wrong thing.
                   Not findable from here — a narrowing rule counted list entries
                   instead of suspects, and a prose check compared full names
                   while the model wrote first names. Both were GREEN. Both cost
                   a generation. Only reading finds these.

WHAT THIS CHECKS, all free and offline:

  1. Every assertion in the inventory below still appears in the prompt. If a
     line is reworded or deleted, its entry is stale and must be re-triaged
     rather than silently kept.
  2. Every rule id the inventory names really exists in a live registry. A
     renamed rule leaves a claim of coverage that no longer holds.
  3. Every imperative line in the prompt is accounted for by some entry. Adding
     a MUST to the prompt without saying what enforces it fails this check --
     which is the whole point: you cannot quietly add an unenforced rule.

The output's standing value is the UNENFORCED list. It is not a bug list; some
of those are deliberate (a witness statement's truthfulness cannot be checked by
any structural rule) and are marked so. What matters is that the list is
explicit, reviewed, and cannot grow by accident.
