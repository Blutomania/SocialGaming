"""
walk_apf_game.py -- play a whole APF game over real HTTP, end to end.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND THE UNIT TESTS DO NOT COVER IT. scripts/test_apf.py proves
the rhythm's rules in-process. This proves the ROUTES: that a room can be
created, assigned, played through four rounds and closed by full disclosure, and
that accusing the last face standing reaches the result screen. Session 42 found
one defect this way that no in-process test could have -- winning fired a live
Claude call, so a 401 took the whole win down with a 500.

ZERO API COST, AND NO API KEY NEEDED. Nothing here generates; it plays the
mystery already on disk. Run the server first:

    python3 -m uvicorn server.main:app --port 8000
    python3 scripts/walk_apf_game.py

Exit: 0 = pass, 1 = failure.
