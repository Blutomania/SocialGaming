## Accusation — player selects a suspect and submits their final answer.
## Compares locally against the solution already in the mystery dict —
## no extra API call needed (the server included the solution in /generate).
##
## SESSION ANNOTATION — Phase 3:
## In multiplayer, accusation must be validated server-side to prevent cheating.
## Add a POST /accuse endpoint and call it here instead of comparing locally.
## The server broadcasts the result to all players.
