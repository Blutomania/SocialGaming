## ApfRound — the APF play screen, and the only screen the mechanic needs.
##
## THIS SCREEN IS THE GAME. With exploration gone there is no traversal, no
## budget and no phase gate; what is left is a casefile, a decision about it, and a
## board that makes the decision visible. docs/PLAYTEST_FLOW.md: "the casefile and
## the share are not part of the game — they are the game."
##
## WHY THE SHARE IS NOT ITS OWN SCREEN. It used to be (ShareSelection.tscn,
## still here and still wired to the gather loop). Under the rhythm the share
## belongs beside the board, because the board is what makes withholding legible
## without a word of explanation: a face stays lit that you could have darkened,
## and everyone can see you didn't. Moving the decision to a separate screen
## hides the one thing that gives it weight.
##
## THE CLIENT DERIVES NOTHING. The round, the requirement, the board and the
## pool all arrive from GET /apf/state. In particular the share minimum is the
## server's own answer — a second implementation of that rule has already cost
## this project a screen's worth of silently-refused legal moves, and
## scripts/test_share_rule.py exists to stop it coming back.
##
## Reached from the lobby once the host has assigned. Leaves for Accusation.tscn.
