## ApplyTheme — makes the design visible in the EDITOR, and checks every theme
## item name against the engine.
##
## Run it from the script editor: File → Run (Ctrl+Shift+X). It needs no
## arguments and spends nothing.
##
## WHY THIS EXISTS. Style.gd assigns the theme to get_tree().root, which only
## has a root at RUN time. Open a scene in the editor and you get engine grey:
## the design is real but invisible while it is being worked on. Godot's
## project-wide default theme (gui/theme/custom) IS honoured by the editor's
## canvas, but it has to be a Resource on disk, and Style.gd's header gives two
## good reasons not to hand-write one — it would be a fourth copy of the
## palette, and a .tres is the same text format that cost Session 36 five
## panels of Interrogation.tscn.
##
## Both objections are about hand-writing it. So this does not hand-write it:
## it calls Style.build_theme(), the same function the game uses, and lets
## ResourceSaver serialise the result. The .tres is a GENERATED PREVIEW of
## Style.gd, never a source. Style.gd stays the one implementation, palette.py
## stays the one place a colour is decided, and regenerating after any change
## to either is this one keystroke.
##
## Runtime is unaffected either way: a Control resolves its theme by walking
## ancestors first, so Style.gd's root assignment still wins at run time and the
## project default is only ever the editor's preview. A stale .tres can
## therefore mislead the editor, but it can never ship a wrong colour.
##
## WHAT THE CHECK IS FOR, AND WHY IT COULD NOT BE WRITTEN BEFORE. Setting a
## theme item Godot does not have is a SILENT no-op — no error, no warning, the
## control just keeps its engine default. Session 37 shipped ten control types
## whose item names nobody could verify, and recorded that "short of running
## Godot there cannot be" a guard. This is that guard: ThemeDB's default theme
## declares every item the engine really has, so every name Style.gd sets can be
## looked up in it. Anything printed under MISSES below is a name the engine
## does not know, i.e. a line of Style.gd that is doing nothing.

## Collected output. The Output panel scrolls and cannot be copied out of easily
## — the owner ran this once, read it, and could not get the MISSES line back
## (Session 40). So every line also goes to a file the terminal can read:
##
##     cat godot/apply_theme_report.txt
##
## The file is regenerated on every run and is gitignored; it is a transcript,
## not a record.
