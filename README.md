# Choose Your Mystery

**An AI-powered social murder mystery party game**, built as a Godot 4 client talking to a
Python FastAPI backend. Players join a lobby, investigate a generated crime, interrogate AI
suspects, share clues, and race to accuse the killer.

You describe a setting — a 1920s jazz club, a Scottish castle, a corporate retreat — and the
backend generates a complete, coherent murder mystery: victim, suspects, motives, alibis,
physical evidence, and a hidden culprit, drawn from a corpus of classic mystery literature.
Every mystery passes an automated coherence check before the game begins.

**Core mechanic:** each player must share 75% of what they learn — forcing collaboration while
preserving individual advantage.

## Status

Godot migration, **Phase 3d** (lobby flow, room codes, multiplayer game start). See `CLAUDE.md`
for the full architecture and `SESSIONS.md` for session-by-session history.

> **This project was originally a single-player Streamlit app hosted on HuggingFace Spaces.**
> That version is retired — all of it is archived under [`deprecated/`](deprecated/) for
> historical reference, not for use. Everything below describes the current Godot + FastAPI
> version.

## Run locally

```bash
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
uvicorn main:app --port 8000
```

Then open `godot/project.godot` in Godot 4 and press F5. Requires an
[Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) and a local install of
[Godot 4](https://godotengine.org).
