"""The arrangement pass — find exonerations nothing reveals, and wire them if honest.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, MEASURED RATHER THAN GUESSED. Three generations in a
row failed the two-routes rule, and in all three the short suspect's exoneration
was *exactly* the one no witness, lead or area pointed at:

    the_last_night_of_delacroix_&_sons   Nadège 1, Rémy 10, Sylvain 5   E6 orphaned
    the_vanishing_at_altheim_peak        Adachi 1, Solberg 4, Novák 2   E11 orphaned
    totality                             Luz    1, Fenwick 4, Sable 4   E10 orphaned

Nobody is short of CLUES -- everyone else has four to ten routes. Exactly one
person has exactly one, every time, and it is always the person whose clue is
unwired. So `NARR.SINGLE_ROUTE` and `REVEAL.UNREACHED_EXONERATION` are not two
failures; they are one defect seen from two sides.

INVENTION VERSUS ARRANGEMENT (Session 40's axis, applied). Writing the clue is
invention and only a model can do it. Deciding that a witness should point at it
is arrangement, and arrangement is set arithmetic: free, deterministic, and
re-runnable. This module does the arrangement half only.

REPAIR THE ARRANGEMENT, NEVER THE EVIDENCE. That is the line, and it is narrower
than it sounds. Wiring an existing witness to an existing clue completes
something the schema requires and the model forgot, and a person can read the
statement and check it. Rewriting a clue's prose until a leak detector stops
firing is optimising against the checker -- Goodhart, and `the_light_that_went_out`
is the standing proof that the checks are not the same as quality. This module
adds pointers. It never touches a word of generated text.

WHY IT REFUSES MORE OFTEN THAN IT ACTS, AND WHY THAT IS THE POINT. deal.py's own
docstring names the risk: "a model can emit reveals: ["E3"] on a statement that
says nothing about E3, and nothing structural can tell." A tool that wires
anything to anything would manufacture exactly that lie and every checker would
go green over it. So a candidate must earn the pointer lexically -- it has to
already be about that evidence -- and the wiring is then re-verified against the
full gate, because adding a pointer can CREATE a violation: a witness who
already reveals two exonerations and gains a third may now solve the case alone
(deal.py constraint 2). Proposals that make the verdict worse are dropped.

WHAT IT FOUND ON THE FIRST MYSTERY IT WAS POINTED AT, which is the reason the
conservatism is not theoretical. In `the_last_night_of_delacroix_&_sons` no
witness mentions Nadège, no lead concerns her performance, and the Big Top --
the one place her alibi lives -- is not an investigable area at all. The other
three suspects each have a location AND a person; she has a piece of paper.
There was no honest carrier to wire, so the tool reports the gap instead of
inventing one, and names the targeted ask that would close it.

That is the deeper finding, and it is a PROMPT fix rather than a tool one:
generation builds the world around the people it is thinking about, and one
suspect ends up with less world than the others.
