# F5 checklist — running the Godot client by hand

The complete procedure for running the desktop client on your own machine, from a terminal prompt
to the result screen. **Every command you need is in here**; nothing is left as "set up the
backend".

**Steps 1–8 and 9–19 cost nothing.** Only steps 20 and 21 spend API credits.

**Why this exists.** Godot reports a bad node path only at runtime, and a control that was never
connected not at all — it just does nothing when clicked. The Python checkers catch what they can
by reading the files, but *reading a scene is not the same as loading it*, and Session 36 proved
that gap twice. This checklist is the part no script can do.

---

## Status — what has actually been walked

**Session 36 (owner, August 26 2026): the free route passed.** Three defects were found and fixed
during that walk, none of which any checker could see:

| Screen | Defect |
|---|---|
| Case screen | `case_display.gd` inferred `Variant` from `Dictionary.get()` — fatal at parse time, so the scene never loaded |
| Interrogation | `#` comment lines in the `.tscn` dropped five panels and every child under them |
| Result screen | GDScript has no implicit string concatenation, so the script never loaded and only static nodes rendered |

**Still unverified:** steps 20 and 21 (the two paid ones), and step 17's negative case.

> **Renumbering note (Session 38).** This document used to open at "sync the repo" and keep its
> setup instructions in an appendix — including a section headed *Step 0, do this first*, which sat
> **after** step 17. It is now one linear sequence. **Session 36 walked what were then steps 1–15;
> those are steps 9–19 here.** Nothing was dropped.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **Godot** | 4.x. `godot/project.godot` declares 4.6; 4.7.2 opens it fine (see *Expected noise*). Download from godotengine.org — the standard build, **not** .NET/Mono. It is a single executable; there is no installer to run |
| **Python** | 3.8+, invoked as `python3` |
| **A terminal** | Two windows, or two tabs. One runs the server and stays running |
| **API key** | **Not needed** for steps 1–19. The Anthropic client is built lazily, so the server boots and serves the whole saved-mystery route with no key set |
| **Time** | ~10 minutes for setup, ~15 for the free route |

---

# Part 1 — Terminal: get the code and prove it is sound

## 1. Get the repo

If you have not cloned it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blutomania/SocialGaming.git
cd SocialGaming
```

If you have:

```bash
cd /path/to/SocialGaming
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Run every command from the **repo root** unless a step says otherwise — several git subcommands
resolve paths relative to your working directory.

Confirm you are where you think you are:

```bash
pwd
git log --oneline -3
```

## 2. Set up Python

A virtual environment is optional on most systems and mandatory on Homebrew Python, which refuses
to install into the system interpreter. Do it anyway — it costs one command and avoids the whole
problem:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

That installs FastAPI, Uvicorn, the Anthropic SDK and python-dotenv.

**The venv is per-terminal.** Every new window needs `source .venv/bin/activate` again. If a later
command reports a missing module, that is almost always why.

## 3. Run the checkers — free, and seconds

Do this **before** opening Godot. It is the cheapest pre-flight there is, and each of these has
already caught a real bug:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_godot_wiring.py
python3 scripts/check_mystery_playable.py
python3 scripts/build_palette.py --check
python3 scripts/build_icons.py --check
python3 scripts/test_palette.py
python3 scripts/check_doc_claims.py
python3 scripts/check_decisions.py
```

Or all of them at once, plus the rest of the free suite:

```bash
for s in check_godot_wiring check_mystery_playable check_doc_claims check_decisions \
         check_solvability test_palette test_icons test_background_field test_share_rule \
         test_crime_scene_map test_registry_staleness; do
  printf '%-30s ' "$s"; python3 "scripts/$s.py" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
done
python3 scripts/build_palette.py --check && python3 scripts/build_icons.py --check
```

**Expect every line to say PASS.** A FAIL here is a bug on disk — fix it before spending time in
the engine, because the engine will only show you the symptom.

**Do not glob `scripts/check_*.py`.** That sweeps in `check_brand_contrast.py`, which measures the
`brand/` artwork rather than the client, needs Pillow (`pip install pillow`), and exits non-zero
without it. It has nothing to do with running the game, and a red line you are meant to ignore is
worse than no line at all. `build_palette.py` and `build_icons.py` are listed separately because
they need `--check` — without it they *rewrite* their generated files.

**Necessary, not sufficient.** These read the project files; they do not load them. Steps 7 and 8
are the checks that use Godot's own loader.

## 4. Start the backend

Its own terminal window, left running for the whole session. It runs in the foreground and dies
with its terminal.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate          # if this is a new window
cd server
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --port 8000
```

**Expect** Uvicorn to print that it is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Leave it alone.

Now, in your **second** terminal:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Expect exactly:** `{"ok":true}`

If the port is already taken, Uvicorn says so. Find what is holding it:

```bash
lsof -i :8000                      # macOS / Linux
```

Either stop that process, or run on another port (`--port 8001`) and change `SERVER_URL` in
`godot/scripts/autoloads/ApiClient.gd` to match.

**To stop the server later:** Ctrl-C in its window.

# Part 2 — Godot: open it, verify it, make the design visible

## 5. Launch Godot and add the project

Open the Godot executable. In the Project Manager, click **Import**, navigate to
`SocialGaming/godot/`, select `project.godot`, and confirm.

## 6. Click **Edit**, not **Run**

A fresh clone has no `godot/.godot/` directory — that is the generated import cache and is never
committed. **Run** fails on it with *"Can't run project: Assets need to be imported first."*

Click **Edit** and let the initial import finish. The fonts and eight SVG icons are imported here.

Then check **Project → Project Settings → Autoload**. **Expect four entries**, in this order:

| | |
|---|---|
| `GameState` | current mystery, phase, history |
| `ApiClient` | HTTP and WebSocket calls to the backend |
| `NetworkManager` | ENet singleton — present but wired to nothing |
| `Style` | builds the theme. **Must be last** — it reads `Palette.gd` |

If `Style` is missing or not last, that alone explains a completely unstyled game.

## 7. Run `VerifyScenes.gd` — before anything else

In the Script editor, open `godot/scripts/tools/VerifyScenes.gd` and press
**File → Run** (`Ctrl+Shift+X`). It takes no arguments, costs nothing, and needs no backend.

It loads all eight screens through Godot's own loader and compares the nodes each `.tscn`
*declares* against the nodes that actually exist once loaded. That is the comparison
`check_godot_wiring.py` cannot make — it reads scene files, and Session 36 proved reading is not
loading when `Interrogation.tscn` passed the checker with five panels missing at runtime.

**Expect eight `ok` lines.** Anything else names the file and the node. Fix it before F5.

## 8. Run `ApplyTheme.gd` — this is what makes the design visible

Same procedure: open `godot/scripts/tools/ApplyTheme.gd`, **File → Run**.

`Style.gd` puts the theme on the scene-tree root, and there is no root at *design* time, so the
editor canvas shows engine grey however much styling exists. This script calls the same
`Style.build_theme()` the game calls, saves the result to `res://assets/theme/cym_theme.tres`, and
points the project's default theme at it.

**Read three things in the Output panel:**

| Line | What it means |
|---|---|
| `fonts` | Whether Nunito Sans actually resolved. On a fresh checkout, if it says the fonts are missing, let the import finish and run it again |
| `MISSES` | Every theme item name the engine does not have. Each is a line of `Style.gd` silently doing nothing. **`none` is the good answer** |
| `wrote` / `set` | The `.tres` was written and the project setting points at it |

Then **reopen a scene** — the editor canvas should now be slate, not grey.

Afterwards, in the terminal:

```bash
git status --short
git add godot/assets/theme/cym_theme.tres godot/project.godot
git commit -m "Generated editor theme preview"
```

**The `.tres` is a generated preview, never a source.** `palette.py` is still the one place a
colour is decided. Re-run this after changing `palette.py` or `Style.gd`. Runtime never reads it —
a Control resolves its theme from its ancestors before the project default, so `Style.gd` still
wins when the game runs.

# Part 3 — The free route · no API spend

## 9. Press F5

F5 is an editor shortcut, so the **editor window must have focus**. The play button in the
top-right toolbar does the same thing, and is the way round a laptop F-key bound to brightness.
Either launches `res://scenes/ui/MainMenu.tscn` in a **new window**, separate from the editor.
F8, or the stop button, ends it.

**Expect:** the title Choose Your Mystery in 44px brass, a muted subtitle, four buttons — New Game
(Solo), Multiplayer, Browse Saved Mysteries, Quit — one of them brass and the rest outlined, a
faint status line at the bottom, and a slate background.

Red *"Backend unreachable"* means step 4's server died, not that the client is broken. Check that
terminal.

**If the whole thing is plain Godot grey**, the theme is not applying at all. Check that `Style` is
the last autoload (step 6).

## 10. Browse Saved Mysteries

**Expect:** a centred window listing **17** rows, each formatted title, difficulty, star rating.

*Not a bug:* "The Murder at Tokyo" and "The Great Cookie Caper of Sesame Street" each appear
twice. Two files on disk resolve to the same slug. Cosmetic and pre-existing.

## 11. Dismiss the popup two ways

Click Close. Reopen. Then dismiss with the window's own close gesture. Both must work — a Godot
`Window` does not hide itself on `close_requested`, the handler has to, and that handler was
unconnected until Session 34.

## 12. Select "Whiteout at Shackleton Base"

The richest case on disk: 8 characters, 4 suspects, 5 investigation areas, coherence passed. It is
also the only mystery whose `key_evidence` matches the evidence its own solution reasons from.

**Expect:** the popup closes and `CaseDisplay.tscn` loads.

If clicking a row does *nothing*, the `item_selected` signal is unconnected again and
`_on_browse_item_selected` is dead code.

## 13. Read the case screen

**Expect:** title, setting, crime, characters and evidence all populated — no empty panels, no raw
null. Two buttons: Interrogate Suspects and Make Accusation. A rating row.

## 14. Open Make Accusation

**Expect** exactly four names, and no orange warning line:

| Suspect | Culprit? |
|---|---|
| Dr. Marcus Hale | **yes** |
| Dr. Yuki Tanaka | no |
| Bjorn Larssen | no |
| Dr. Felix Caron | no |

The dropdown is built from `characters` filtered to the suspect role, so victims and witnesses must
not appear — 8 characters in, 4 names out.

**Open the dropdown and look at the list itself.** A `PopupMenu` is a separate theme type from the
control that opens it, so a dark control opening a light-grey list is the classic half-themed look.

## 15. Accuse the wrong person — Dr. Yuki Tanaka

Submit, then confirm at the dialog.

**Expect** the result screen: a red verdict naming who you accused and who the culprit was, a full
solution breakdown (culprit, method, motive, key evidence, how to deduce), a rating row, and the
buttons Play Again and Review Case.

A blank screen, or an error naming a node path under `ScrollContainer`, means the Session 34 fix to
`result_screen.gd` regressed. That commit was the entire end-of-game screen.

## 16. Rate the mystery

Click a rating button. This posts to the rate endpoint — a disk write, no Claude call. Expect no
error, and the request visible in the server terminal.

## 17. The culprit-matching regression — "The Stolen Star of Smurf Village"

Browse to it and accuse **Smurfwick the Craftsmurf**.

This mystery's culprit field is a prose sentence naming two culprits, so exact matching marked
*every* accusation wrong, including both right ones.

**Expect:** correct. Repeat with **Smurfadel, Master of Adornment** — also correct.

**Then the case nobody has run: Smurfodex, Keeper of the Great Smurf Tome must read *wrong*.**
The fix was substring matching with a short-name guard, and a fix like that can go too far. This is
the step that proves it did not.

*Cosmetic, expected:* the verdict prints the raw culprit field, so you will see the whole prose
string. Ugly, not a failure. The underlying cause is `docs/DECISIONS.md` item 18, still open.

## 18. Both exits from the result screen

Review Case returns to `CaseDisplay`; Play Again returns to `MainMenu`. Two different
destinations, neither throwing.

## 19. Interrogation screen — reachable without spending

From a loaded case, click Interrogate Suspects. **Do not ask a question yet** — the screen itself
is free, each question is not.

**Expect:** the header reading Phase 1, budget text reading "Ask as many questions as you like."
(not *0 questions remaining*), and a populated suspect dropdown.

This screen failed in Session 36 with *"Cannot call method 'add_item' on a null value"* because
`Interrogation.tscn` used `#` comment lines, which drop the node declared after them. That is
fixed; this step confirms it.

**Stop here and take stock.** If 1–19 pass, the free route is clear. Everything below spends money
and can wait.

---

# Part 4 — The paid route · costs API credits

Both steps need a key. In the **server's** terminal, before starting it:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."      # Windows: set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

Then restart the server (Ctrl-C, then the step 4 command again). The client needs no key — it never
sees one.

## 20. One interrogation · ~1 call

Ask a single question. Expect an in-character reply in the history.

## 21. One generation · 1 large call

New Game (Solo) → a scenario → Generate Mystery. Real generations on record have taken **112 to
1,992 seconds**, so give it room.

**Expect:** the prompt box, the moderation disclaimer visible beneath it, the cinematic-brief
checkbox, and on success a brand-new case on `CaseDisplay`.

Watch for JSON parse errors. An old batch summary shows 13 of 14 generations failing that way; it
is from March and 16 have generated cleanly since, but this run is the confirmation nobody has done.

# Reference

## Expected noise — none of these are failures

- **Godot 4.7 modifying files.** Opening a 4.6 project in 4.7 re-saves `godot/project.godot` and
  `godot/scenes/ui/MainMenu.tscn`, which then show as modified in `git status`.
- **Untracked `.uid` files.** Godot generates these sidecars for scripts and assets that lack them.
  They are meant to be committed — Godot 4.4+ expects it.
- **A default window and taskbar icon.** `config/icon` is deliberately unset. It used to name a
  file that has never existed, which put a failed-load error in the Output panel on every open.

## Things that will look broken and are correct

| What you will see | Why it is right |
|---|---|
| **No icons anywhere** | `Icons.gd` and `IconSet.gd` exist and are tested, but **no screen calls them yet** |
| **No strewn title in the background** | The BACKGROUND field is layout-only and wired to no client. Flat slate *is* the specified pre-prompt state |
| **Panels look sunken, not raised** | Deliberate. The surface ramp goes *deeper* than the ground so the field stays behind everything |
| **Semantic colours look pale** | Forced, not chosen. A saturated red cannot clear 4.5:1 on a mid-slate ground |
| **An unslashed zero in the room code** | Nunito Sans has one. Generate a code and look at it across the room; if `0`/`O` is ambiguous the fix is a mono face for that one label, not a different UI font |

## Failures that are completely silent

**A theme item name the engine does not have is a no-op** — no error, no warning, the control keeps
its engine default. So the symptom is not a crash; it is one control type looking unthemed while
everything around it looks right. Step 8's `MISSES` block is the guard.

The 13 theme type variations (`DisplayLabel`, `TitleLabel`, `MysteryTitleLabel`, `HeadingLabel`,
`MutedLabel`, `FaintLabel`, `CautionLabel`, `ErrorLabel`, `PositiveLabel`, `PrimaryButton`,
`QuietButton`, `DangerButton`, `WellPanel`) fail the same way — an unrecognised variation falls back
to the base type. Quick tell: if the main menu title is not 44px brass, variations are not applying
at all.

**Scrollbars are the loudest tell.** Unthemed they are bright grey, which on this ground would make
them the brightest thing on the case screen.

## Fonts

The `.ttf` files become `FontFile` resources on first import. If a face did not load, `Style.gd`
pushes a warning naming the missing path and keeps the engine default — assigning a null
`default_font` would strip every label in the product with no error at all. Step 8's `fonts` line
reports the same thing off the built theme.

## Icons

The generated SVGs carry `width`/`height` as well as `viewBox`. A viewBox-only SVG has no intrinsic
size and Godot's importer has to invent one, possibly at a scale that makes the icon a few pixels
across, with no error. If icons import tiny, the fix is the **Scale** field in the Import dock, then
Reimport.

They are **white on purpose** — the generated files are a coverage mask, so an unmodulated icon on
the slate ground looks stark white. Anything drawing one should set `modulate`.

## What this checklist does not test

- **Two defensive branches on the accusation screen.** All 17 saved mysteries have suspects, and
  every culprit resolves to at least one — so neither the no-suspects message nor the unsolvable
  warning can fire from saved data. They have no test case on disk.
- **Multiplayer entirely** — lobby, room codes, the share mechanic, the WebSocket path, and
  `server/static/mobile.html`. Stage 3.
- **APF** — `docs/DECISIONS.md` item 23, not built.
- **Anything visual.** Whether the screens read well is a judgement only a human at the screen can
  make. Note it as you go.

## If something breaks

Capture three things:

1. The **step number**.
2. The **Output panel** text, verbatim.
3. The **Debugger** tab's stack trace if it froze rather than misbehaved.

Two diagnostic habits that paid off in Session 36:

- **The error line is often the symptom, not the cause.** A null-method error names the first line
  that touched a null, not the reason it was null. The running scene's **remote inspector** shows
  which node references resolved and which are empty, which is what actually located the bug.
- **A parse error appears only when its scene first loads.** Godot parses a script when the scene
  needs it, so a broken screen stays silent until you click through to it.
